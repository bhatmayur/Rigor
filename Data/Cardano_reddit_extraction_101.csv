#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-05-13 05:30:10

4,"Me: 

Referring to your data, what exactly does the Cardano network do? I want you to go into as much detail about liquidity pools, and what these pools can do to start markets. And also consider what the possibilites could be if a company like CoinBase created a partnership with Cardano in providing liquidity pools for all coins with direct access to public market. 

GPT-4:

 

The Cardano network is a public blockchain platform. It is open-source and decentralized, with consensus achieved using proof-of-stake. It can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its internal cryptocurrency, Ada. Cardano was founded in 2015 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. The development was begun in 2015 led by the company IOHK.

Key features of Cardano include:

1. **Layered Architecture**: Cardano has a unique two-layered architecture: the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) for transferring Ada tokens, and the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) for smart contract functionality. This layered architecture separates the ledger of account values from the reason why values are moved from one account to the other. This separation is intended to make smart contracts safer.
2. **Proof of Stake**: Cardano uses a unique proof-of-stake consensus algorithm called Ouroboros. Unlike proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin, where miners must solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks, proof-of-stake systems are based on the amount of each participant's stake.
3. **Peer-Reviewed Research**: Cardano distinguishes itself in the blockchain community through a commitment to peer-reviewed scientific research as building blocks for updates to its platform. Research papers and a dedicated research team form the backbone of Cardano's development.

Now let's dive into liquidity pools. A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract. They are used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity and are extensively used in many DeFi (decentralized finance) applications. Users provide the liquidity to these pools and receive LP (liquidity provider) tokens in return, which can be used to claim their share of the pool, or their stake, at any time.

When markets are started on platforms like Uniswap or Sushiswap (on the Ethereum network), they are initiated with a liquidity pool containing a certain amount of each of the two assets being paired. As more liquidity is provided, the market becomes more stable, and the price of the assets becomes less susceptible to large price movements due to large trades.

The possibilities if a company like Coinbase created a partnership with Cardano to provide liquidity pools for all coins would be immense:

1. **Increased Liquidity**: Having liquidity pools on a platform like Coinbase would mean access to a large number of traders and funds, increasing the liquidity of the markets and making them more stable.
2. **Cross-Chain Swaps**: If this partnership includes a bridge between different blockchains (like Ethereum and Cardano), it could enable direct trading between the tokens of these different blockchains, further enhancing liquidity.
3. **Increased Adoption**: This partnership could also lead to increased adoption of the Cardano network. If a significant player like Coinbase backs Cardano, it could draw more projects to build on Cardano.
4. **Greater Exposure**: Users of the Coinbase platform could gain direct access to coins and tokens within the Cardano ecosystem, giving these tokens more exposure.
5. **Enhanced DeFi Activities**: DeFi activities could also be greatly enhanced on Cardano with the influx of liquidity, potentially leading to a thriving DeFi ecosystem on Cardano comparable to that on Ethereum.
6. **Institutional Interest**: Such a partnership could also increase institutional interest in Cardano, potentially leading to more institutional investment in the Cardano network and its tokens.

Please note that this is hypothetical and depends on the specifics of the partnership and how well it is executed. Also, partnerships like this have regulatory considerations that need to be taken into account.",2023-05-12 21:23:28

Foreon Network is an information market platform where users can trade on the predicted outcome of future events, creating a share portfolio based on their forecasts to earn a return. It offers an alternative to betting platforms with high fees, restrictions, and poor accessibility.

Following on from the launch of a global workshop grant fund, Input Output Global (IOG), EMURGO, and the Cardano Foundation are thrilled to announce the successful applicants to run a workshop to discuss [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/tree/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5CLpwb1Pje9gjyDtl0y4KzPfsPrVAYZXeZGoMrstjsG65FHgdmS7mgbJdtiwGnlywmA48). Over 75 quality and diverse applications from around the world were received. Submissions from North America, LATAM, and Africa made up over 80% of all applications, evidencing the strength of Cardano’s roots and interest in the future of on-chain governance.

The workshops, which will take place from May to July, will explore the latest developments in Cardano's on-chain governance proposed in CIP-1694. The in-person workshops will take place in over 20 locations worldwide, giving attendees the opportunity to network, confer, and collaborate with their local Cardano communities. On top of that, there will be over 25 virtual workshops, further opening opportunities to those who cannot attend in-person.

Have you heard about Cardano's parameter committee ? It meets on a bi-weekly basis. The parameter committee is an interim group which discusses all parameters relating to the Cardano protocol including network, technical and economic parameter type. They are a technical advisory group and only make recommendations.

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Proposal creation metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/511?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5CLpwb1Pje9gjyDtl0y4KzPfsPrVAYZXeZGoMrstjsG65FHgdmS7mgbJdtiwGnlywmA48) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal presents a generic transaction metadata standard that can be used for generic governance proposals.

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CIP-0070? | Add rejected CIP for spending policies](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/336?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5CLpwb1Pje9gjyDtl0y4KzPfsPrVAYZXeZGoMrstjsG65FHgdmS7mgbJdtiwGnlywmA48):
   * This proposal stands to explain why allowing native tokens on Cardano to have a *spending* policy in addition to their *minting* policy is an idea that should be rejected.
* [CPS-01 | Metadata Discoverability and Trust](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/371?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5CLpwb1Pje9gjyDtl0y4KzPfsPrVAYZXeZGoMrstjsG65FHgdmS7mgbJdtiwGnlywmA48):
   * This problem statement aims to illustrate the problem of the discovery and trust for off-chain metadata.
   * This is a common problem area for Blockchain systems.

Next Meeting:

* CIP Editors Meeting #66:
   * May 16th 9:30am UTC.
   * Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_5CLpwb1Pje9gjyDtl0y4KzPfsPrVAYZXeZGoMrstjsG65FHgdmS7mgbJdtiwGnlywmA48).

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems.

The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.

I checked the tweets where Nagel revealed that the Hydra node version 0.10.0 has been released following successful demonstrations of Hydra heads on the Cardano mainnet in recent review sessions.   
 

I mostly play Caradano games such as Chains of War and Space Troopers alongside other blockchain games -  Splinterlands and MagicCraft, so it's nice to have this development since it marks a significant step forward in Cardano's journey to boost its scalability and adaptability.   
 

The 0.10.0 version of the hydra-node includes numerous technical changes and improvements that were deemed necessary before a Hydra head could be used with real-world transactions on the mainnet.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

It would be healthy for the blockchain industry if the projects in the top 3 changed regularly from time to time. Competition is good for technological progress. It would force teams to innovate faster, which would benefit users. Things that the entire blockchain industry has been waiting for years would be delivered sooner. 

If you trust a project and it is useful to you, you should theoretically not care what position it is in. The obsession with market capitalization is strongly present in the cryptocurrency world and arouses a lot of passion, but in reality, it doesn't matter that much. We believe that changing the order of the top 3 projects would attract media attention in the short term, but after a while people would get used to it and it would cease to be an interesting topic for the majority of the population.

Bitcoin is dominant and many believe it will remain so forever. However, if Bitcoin were replaced by another project, it would shatter some false narratives and we believe it would have a positive impact. People like to speculate about when Ethereum will replace Bitcoin in the top position by market capitalization. The chances are quite high. Can Cardano ever become the #1 project too? 

We say up front that we don't know and we don't consider it important. However, we offer some interesting points of view.

# TLDR

Technological progress is gradually eroding the old narratives. It is common for current innovations to become outdated and conservative over time. What is conservative is often replaced by more efficient ones. It is necessary to abandon the old narratives and perceive reality. The number of users of DeFi services and tokens is constantly growing.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

47,"One of Cardano's advantages over other chains is the predictable fees for on-chain services. Cardano processes transactions on a first-come, first-served basis. Unlike most blockchains, the transaction fee size does not increase when the network is under pressure. However, this approach is not ideal. Block space is a scarce resource that can be in high demand. As demand increases, the value of block space should also increase. Most networks use a so-called fee-market mechanism that allows block producers to choose transactions based on the size of the fee. If the network is clogged for an extended period of time, people fight over block space and fees skyrocket. It may be fair, but it's not inclusive. They say that in this case, only the rich can use the blockchain. Come see what tiered pricing will bring.

# TLDR

Tiered pricing allows users to set the fee according to how urgent their transaction is. If they pay a higher fee, the transaction will be processed quickly. Transactions that are less urgent will be cheaper. Cardano will thus remain, at least partly, inclusive.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

61,"Traditional banks and cryptocurrency exchanges are collapsing. Blockchain is an emerging technology that can potentially improve how banks operate. DeFi offers an alternative to the traditional financial world. When else but now is the chance to get the spotlight. Unfortunately, instead of DeFi, the media is filled with articles about meme coins. The craze started thanks to unexpected Bitcoin innovation, namely projects Ordinals, and BRC-20. Speculators have started to get excited about the possibility of issuing tokens on Bitcoin. The craze soon spread to Ethereum and we have beautiful new meme coins in the Cardano ecosystem as well. Bitcoin and Ethereum are congested and many transactions are waiting in the mem pool. Transaction fees are skyrocketing. Cardano is also slowly approaching its throughput limit. Are meme coins the blockchain industry's best answer to failing banks? We can agree that it's definitely not. The current mania has reopened debates about the scalability of the first layers and the readiness of the blockchain industry for the financial revolution. Are meme coins useful for the Cardano ecosystem? 

# TLDR

We should not attract speculators to the Cardano ecosystem, but people who may want to use staking, or hold stablecoin DJED instead of USD in an unreliable bank. The existence of meme coins tests the reliability of Cardano and 20% of the transaction fees go to the treasury. Meme coins have reopened the topic of the low scalability of blockchains. Ouroboros Leios may improve Cardano's scalability by several orders of magnitude.

# Do meme coins really attract new users?

It is a widely held view that meme coins attract new users to the ecosystem, so their existence is good for the blockchain industry. Is this really the case? Has anyone asked how many people are rather repelled by meme coins and how many people have left because of it? We are convinced that meme coins are mainly bought by people who have already installed a wallet and know how to use the network. I don't think that newcomers will be attracted by strange-looking characters and a token with no utility. The problem is that meme coins are often created just to temporarily pump up their market capitalization. Newcomers serve as exit liquidity. Do we really want the first experience of people entering the blockchain industry to be scams of this type? Inexperienced people may believe that if something is increasing in market value, it must be a good buy. Before they figure out how the rules of the game work, they will lose.

66,"What's up Cardano! Have been seeing some people commenting on the Daily Discussion threads right here in our home r/Cardano, and how they are very low traffic at this time. If you look at any of the most recent ones, the engagement is usually five comments or less. Incidentally, sometimes even those are just meta-comments about how there is no one really using the daily threads.

After speaking with people in those threads, and other members of the Cardano community, I wanted to put forward a proposal to rethink the daily, and maybe change things up a bit to make it more interesting and fun:

**Schedule**: instead of copying and pasting (or auto-scheduling) the same text for the daily everyday, make it into a weekly or every epoch general discussion thread. This will be a good way for people to keep up with some general conversation happening in the community, and for people to come back and talk shop on all things Cardano.

**Post Content**:  In addition to the standard text for a daily thread, a Week of April 20th or Epoch 410 thread (for example) could include a list of interesting events or important dates happening in the world of Cardano during that time. For example:

**Happening this Epoch:**

|Date|Event|Link|
|:-|:-|:-|
|April 20, 2020|Project Catalyst Voting Begins|linktoawesomestuff(.)io|
|April 21, 2020|Lace Mobile Release|iLace(.)io|
|April 22, 2020|Cardano Summit - London|ADAlondon(.)io|
|April 23, 2020|FutureFest Live Event|yaysuperfun(.)io|
|April 24, 2020|Awesome Hackathon Begins|l33th4ck3r(.)io|

For what might be included in this, we could encourage people in the thread to make a comment if they have something interesting coming up that they want added into the next Weekly/Epoch thread. ""Do you have something interesting coming up? Let us know below! Provide the name, date, a single, relevant link"" This might be optimal rather than an off-reddit Google form -> Spreadsheet -> Reddit post approach. It's less backend work, people in the comments can ask questions to those hosting or involved with those events, and everyone could see who submits what to share with the subreddit community. This doesn't have to be a comprehensive overview of literally everything in the ecosystem, but rather, and more specifically, a highlight of the types of things people using the subreddit are interested in talking about or sharing.

**User Comments**: Allow the posting of images from reddit users in the comments to make the interactions more interesting and fun. This would be subreddit-wide, but would make the daily perhaps more engaging. Media in comments can be set up in the mod settings under Settings > Posts and Comments > Media in Comments.

**Future Changes:**

Of course, if we start to get a lot of everyday users of r/Cardano again, then it might be worthwhile to revert everything back into a daily thread when needed. But for the time being, I think it might be worthwhile to rethink how everyday engagement happens here, and the general discussion threads seem like a great place to start.

**TL:DR:**

* Very low engagement numbers in the current Daily Threads.
* Change up the daily thread to make it more periodical every week or every epoch.
* Have it be a quick reference point for things happening all around Cardano during that time.
* Encourage people to participate more by sharing different things happening, and enjoy the comment sections with things like pictures and gifs.
* Could be reverted to a daily if/when user engagement returns to more active numbers.

These are just some ideas - what do you think would be a meaningful change to make if any?",2023-05-09 03:35:03

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Ive tried gnosis safe and they recently added milkomeda chain to access cardano for their multi sig wallet. However, they only support a few coins and no nfts, so very limited atm.

Are there any cardano native wallets that offer multi sig?

69,"Does anyone now why blocksize is fixed on most blockchains? I just thought about what would happen if a blockchain lets its validators/miners choose how many transactions from the mempool they want to include in a block (within certain limits) This would allow for enhanced base layer scaling (big validators would create big blocks in times of high network activity), without forcing smaller players out due to increasing hardware requirements. Now only storage becomes the problem, but that could be fixed in other ways in the future (like condensing the history of the chain cyclically). To me it seems this would be a better approach then having a fixed blocksize. This applies to cardano but also to Bitcoin and ethereum. If someone here has any insights please let me know.",2023-05-08 06:47:01

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

80,"Hi everyone,

It's something I never really understood about Cardano and I think it's time to ask as I want to consolidate all my ADA spread out across multiple wallets into 1 wallet.

So I've got this old Hot wallet created with Nami and I as you can see in the below Cardanoscan screenshot, this wallet has got multiple addresses and more specifically 1 address with  1.17ADA and another address with  3.21ADA.

[https://i.imgur.com/vrnXzEZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/vrnXzEZ.png)

The thing I don't understand is that on Nami, it only shows 1.17ADA as asset. No mention anywhere of the 3.21ADA.

\- Why was it designed that way? Wouldn't be better that Nami displayed total asset for a WALLET and not only for the last ADDRESS?

\- How can I access those 3.21ADA I can't see on NAMI?

\- What I want to do is empty this wallet and send the 3.21+1.17 ADA to my cold wallet. What's the best way to achieve this with Nami?

Thanks",2023-05-08 03:49:52

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems.

The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.

I’m just wondering does anyone know why I’m seeing a lot of hype as to doing this. Why swap? What do meme coins offer? Why swap ADA? What are the upsides?

105,"I was just looking at the new Bitcoin standard for token minting and transfer, BRC-20. I have to admit that I don't like it technically at all. We'll get to the details in the article. It made me realize how important it is when innovation is wanted and well thought out. The IOG team could have learned from the Ethereum project and designed the functionality around tokens in a different way. Many members of the Bitcoin Core team did not want to enable NFT and token minting at the first layer. Yet, one Core developer from the team managed to deliver this functionality. I'm sure you've heard of the Ordinals project. Unfortunately, the resulting solution is more of a hack (some talk about source code abuse) than a well-thought-out design. BRC-20 looks to me like another hack built on a hack. Cardano, and Ethereum as well, have a few years ahead of Bitcoin when it comes to minting and token transfer. In my opinion, Bitcoin should not catch up with SC platforms and should remain simple. From a governance perspective, the Ordinals and BRC-20 project is very interesting, as tokens on Bitcoin are a controversial topic that divides the community. In this context, it is important to realize the importance of CIP-1694.

**TLDR**

The Ordinals project can be seen as a betrayal by the part of the community that wanted Bitcoin to be only a store of value and nothing else. Freedom is not the same as the inability to agree on the best possible solution. On-chain governance is essential to the mission of blockchain projects. The team must serve the community. In the context of the Ordinals, I see CIP-1694 in a new perspective.

106,"CIP-60, for those who do not know, is a standard for publishing musical tokens on chain.  This formalizes the metadata in a way that allows for predictable parsing of the linked assets.    


The biggest issue, IMO, is the fact that these links are typically publicly accessible.  Any token's content can be viewed on [pool.pm](https://pool.pm) or extrapolated from the metadata on any block explorer without owning the token.  This then begs the question, what is the point of purchasing the token if you have access to the content for free (so long as there is a mint)?    


Are you guys buying music tokens on Cardano for any other reason than to support the artist in good faith?  How is this ""revolutionary"" for the musician trying to monetize their content?",2023-05-05 06:48:46

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

109,"Greetings Beautiful Cardano!

I am making a post to encourage the community, as well as those involved in official Cardano organizations, to make an effort to rethink, revise, and improve the Moderation Team of the official Cardano subreddit, r/Cardano.

For some time, people have expressed frustration at the moderation policies of this forum. As the largest online representation of the Cardano community on reddit, it is home to over 600K subscribers, and is often the first-stop destination for redditors when they want to check out the Cardano ecosystem.

I [made a post today](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/137mbwu/hosky_to_partner_with_united_nations_refugee/) around 10:30am EST, which are peak Reddit hours for traffic, and are well-known as the [best time periods](https://techjury.net/blog/best-time-to-post-on-reddit/) to post content on the site and have it be seen. However, after nearly six hours, this post (concerning a new Cardano Foundation partnership with HOSKY and the United Nations Refugee Agency) remains unapproved.

As I have personally encountered these types of frustrations in the past, I thought it was important to examine [the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/about/moderators/), and look into how active they are on the platform.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zdzc1ls9ivxa1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1275e4922189b69b3fb92c9f9b798e03a5f074d

As can be seen in this breakdown of the first page\* of current Moderation team, the majority of the team are no longer active in the r/Cardano subreddit, and some no longer active on Reddit at all. In other words, the people who run Cardano's subreddit aren't even redditors. The only exception to this is u/SL13PNIR, who is in charge of posting the Daily Discussion threads, and has been active in comments with subscribers to the subreddit. Very cool to see!

\*EDIT: Thank you to u/dominatingslash for pointing out the additional page of moderators for this subreddit. I generally use old.reddit, and missed the pagination at the top right making this post with new.reddit\*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cedj3hcfcwxa1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c0dc74949a946dc09c4d2b3823599905ee2e50c

The remaining moderators on the second-page of admins have a very similar theme as the first. Many have not been active in the subreddit this year, with the exceptions of u/dominatingslash, and u/danny_cryptofay, who have done really amazing work on a consistent basis. Meanwhile, there are others tasked with the curation of this forum who have never made a single post or comment in the community. 

As this subreddit community is so large, I believe that the Moderation team should be improved to include members of our community who are more active, both on reddit and in the Cardano ecosystem as a whole. The burden of content moderation should not have to fall on a small team of still-active moderators on the team.

There was a [previous Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/r-cardano-subreddit-discussion-about-rule-4-no-spamming-advertising-or-low-value-content/116271/22) post about the ownership of the subreddit, but it seems nothing has come from it to date.

The coming years will see a returning interest in cryptocurrencies as market conditions change, and bull runs will bring a bunch of new eyes to blockchain and the Cardano ecosystem in particular. In order for us to be fully prepared for an influx of new users, as well as to improve the curation, promotion, and conversations in our ecosystems, the restructuring of the r/Cardano moderation team is an **imperative**.

I am curious to know your thoughts on this regard, and if anyone has some ideas as to how we might start to make these improvements. Thank you very kindly on your time, and hope you keep cooking on Cardano!

127,"People could first buy ADA in 2017 when the bull market was just peaking. Cardano is actually a few years older than that, and the project's roots go back to 2014/2015. However, what is particularly important is the year when the blockchain was launched, which is 2017. Cardano survived the crypto-winter and is now in its second bear market. We are in 2023, so Cardano has been around for more than 5 full years. If you look at the projects in the top 10 between 2017 and 2023, you will see that only 4 projects have remained in the top 10. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Cardano. It is very likely that Cardano will be around for at least another 5 years and if it manages to stay relevant and ideally in the top 10, its lifespan will be counted in decades.

# TLDR

Cardano has a strong community, which is a necessary prerequisite for success alongside technology. The Cardano brand is very popular, even more so than Bitcoin. However, the Lindy effect of Bitcoin and Cardano is very similar and both projects have almost the same chance of survival.

The only DEXes I have experience with are [SundaeSwap](https://www.sundaeswap.finance/) (DEX and automated liquidity provision protocol) and [HoudiniSwap](https://houdiniswap.com/) (you can swap cryptos anonymously and break the link with sending/receiving wallets). 

And so far I have heard a lot of good things on this sub about these 3 as well:

[Minswap](https://minswap.org/) \- Fast and user friendly, and you can swap tokens with minimal cost and time.

[MuesliSwap](https://muesliswap.com/) \- First Cardano DEX. I also heard a lot of good things about it’s DEX Aggregator. You also get to choose a lot of tokens and make trading cost efficient.

[Wingriders](https://www.wingriders.com/) \- You can swap, stake and provide liquidity to pools and deposit into yield farms. In terms of security, it’s also great.

If you guys have any more recommendations for some good DEXes for Cardano, let me know.",2023-05-03 09:09:20

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

131," **Cardano Over Coffee** ☕☕ W/ **Minswap  📊📉📈**

**Minswap** \- The first multi-pool decentralized exchange on #cardano  | Yield Farming  

**Minswap** is a #decentralized  Exchange (DEX). The purpose of a #dex  is to enable permission less trading of token pairs. For each swap, a fee is taken, which goes to the Liquidity Providers (LPs).  Anyone can provide Liquidity as well, hence profits are decentralized. 

**Minswap** is a community-centric DEX, in that our tokens are fairly distributed, without any private or VC investment. Minswap has pioneered several ideas in the Cardano ecosystem such as the FISO model (touted as the fairest ISO model in the Cardano community) the MINt Token, and has continued developing several value adding features.   

**Features** 

**Community First**: MIN tokens are distributed fairly to protocol participants and Liquidity Providers, who can participate in governance and vote democratically on protocol changes. 

**Innovation-Driven**: We pioneered ideas such as the FISO model, the MINt token, or the Liquidity Bootstrapping Event and plan to continue doing so with further novel initiatives.  

**Launchpool**: Minswap is permissionless, meaning anybody can list tokens without needing KYC. For promising Cardano projects that want to use some of the most potent DeFi primitives to  bootstrap their liquidity directly on the Minswap platform, we have designed the Minswap Launch Bowl.

141,"The NFT sector is one of the most discussed topics around blockchain. NFTs have gone through a hype that has waned in the bear market. Were NFTs just an experiment that failed, or will they come back even stronger? From our perspective, NTFs technology is sound and will form a substantial part of Web3. What is crucial for the success of NTFs is not so much the individual projects but the possibility to create new business models. Cardano is, in our view, one of the best platforms for minting NFTs as there is no need to use a smart contract for minting and they are native tokens much like ADA coins. What needs to emerge now at Cardano are new platforms that will allow authors and publishers to create new and better business models that will be more profitable for authors and users than the existing ones. And that is an achievable goal.

# TLDR

The combination of NFTs and new business models will drive adoption. Through the NFT, you can buy and own a digital work with resale rights, not just a license with usage rights. In addition, the authors of the work can receive royalties from each sale on the secondary market.

This is very master crypto expert level question i guess, but I'd like to hear it. AFAIK Cardano useds some kind of Blake256b algorithm.

As part of the continuing journey toward broader community empowerment with Voltaire, the Cardano Foundation has announced a new on-chain poll on network parameters. Here's the introductory paragraph of [the piece published here:](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/entering-voltaire-on-chain-poll-for-spos/?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny)  


""The Cardano Foundation wants to ensure that, in true Voltaire fashion, the various involved parties have a voice in the process.

As a first step, we invite all stake pool operators (SPOs) to take part in an on-chain poll experiment that will help shape the future of Cardano.

...

The on-chain poll follows this approach and indeed builds on the mechanism proposed by the Foundation in [CIP-0094](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/496?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny). The poll will ask SPOs for their stake-weighted opinion on potential changes to parameters and values, giving the Foundation valuable insights into what the community needs as well as its preferences. It likewise applies action 7 of the governance actions detailed in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/blob/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694/README.md?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny).""

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny) as well.

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | On-chain Transaction Chaining](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/508?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal outlines alterations needed to ledger to allow on-chain transaction chaining.
* [CIP-???? | Representing the Script Context as a SOP term](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/507?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal suggests using sums-of-products (SOPs) in Plutus Core (proposed in [CIP-85?](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/455?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--9fzqTnGP1La62HBBKpw-3EJce3a8jf56EHEpI2agn-2etQ-RztrEVMWhkql_Tyff_R8Ny)) to represent script contexts.

## Weekly GitHub Repo Round Up

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems.

The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

## Project Catalyst is looking ahead - Recap

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Couple weeks ago, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. Then, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting. Recently, in its first, we reviewed the Catalyst technology stack and the path ahead.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

165,"
I wanted to check my staking rewards after around 16 months without touching anything. Did the syncing progress twice in Daedalus and it shows me zero balance. I had something around 6200 coins the last time i checked. Already tried restoring my wallet on Eternl, also zero balance. Also no transactions are displayed. 

The pc i set up the wallet is still in use, but i don’t have the opportunity to do the syncing on it and check if there’s any coins. 

Am i missing something here? The Byron and Shelley thing is also new to me. Did i have to move them before the new era or something? 

Cardano is my favorite project since the end of 2020 and i would be truly pissed if i actually lost them, even tho i have my seed phrase which is 100% correct. 

Any suggestions and/or help would be highly appreciated.",2023-04-29 13:15:09

171,"Creating a burn address can be useful for getting rid of unwanted tokens taking up space in your wallet. They're also useful for Cardano projects that need a quick and simple way to burn tokens without developing smart contracts.

## How do Cardano's minting and burning policies work?

Most Cardano tokens are minted with a time-lock policy, which means that one person has unlimited authority to mint as many tokens as they want for a short period (e.g., 10 minutes). After this time, no more tokens can be minted. This essentially allows tokens to be created with a fixed supply because it's impossible to mint any more tokens after the expiration time.

However, the token cannot be burned due to the same policy used for minting and burning in Cardano. If burning remains open, then minting also stays open, which is not desirable for most tokens.

Developers can create smart contracts for minting and burning policies, but this requires effort and expertise. When projects first begin development, it's usually not a priority to develop a smart contract for the minting policy. The policy is also immutable, meaning it's permanent, so the developers must get it right the first time. This is why many projects use time-locked minting policies as they're quick and easy for minting new tokens.

## Creating a burn address

A burn address is an address that can receive tokens but cannot spend them. This means that any funds sent to the address are permanently destroyed and cannot be recovered.

To create a burn address, make a Cardano multi-sig wallet that's not spendable. An easy way to do this is to create a multi-sig with an expiry date in the past. For extra assurance, make the multi-sig with a start date greater than the expiry date. You can easily create multi-sig wallets in Cardano using RoundTable.

1. Open RoundTable and click ""New Wallet.""
2. Under ""Policy,"" click ""Add Timelock.""
3. Select ""Start Slot"" and set it to January 31st, 2023 (slot 83553309), then click ""Confirm.""
4. Add a second timelock, choose ""Expiry Slot,"" and set it to January 1st, 2023 (80961309), then click ""Confirm.""
5. Ensure ""All"" is selected so that 2 out of 2 signatures are required.
6. Name the wallet (e.g., Burn) and click ""Save"" to create it.

The address produced is `addr1xxkgn29fpa36sn4rc8vx485ysp6jaxj8rp7jq9kkqdlrac9v3x52jrmr4p828swcd20gfqr496dywxrayqtdvqm78msq6s3dg5`. Any funds sent to this address cannot be spent, and you can verify this yourself by following the same steps. Sending your tokens to this address will cause them to be irrevocably not spendable.",2023-04-28 13:02:40
172,"It is commonly said that Bitcoin is the best possible use for blockchain and that the technology is not suitable for anything else. Let's debunk this myth once and for all. Before Bitcoin was launched, there was another famous distributed network that revolutionized the media industry and started its gradual disruption. Although the exact numbers are not known, this network was used by tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of people around the world, and in its heyday accounted for up to 35% of internet traffic. We are talking about the BitTorrent network. If a distributed network was able to disrupt an industry long ago, why do people believe 20 years later that it can't be done again? What's the bigger problem? Being cut off from your bank account or having your social network account deleted? Both are a problem. In the West, we have reliable third parties we can trust, but in developing countries the situation is different. Nor do people have access to mainstream banking services such as loans or insurance. People may not always trust third parties and look for an alternative. A distributed network can solve many real problems. I even dare to say that in many places on the planet, people need things other than volatile cryptocurrencies. Their lives will be fundamentally improved if current services can be disrupted, or if services to which they do not have access are made available. Cardano can be as or more successful as BitTorrent was.

# TLDR

Blockchain solves a general problem and is suitable wherever an expensive and inefficient intermediary abuses its position. The ability to create digital scarcity and define rules that are protected by decentralization is the biggest innovation that blockchain has brought. In order to use blockchain to solve more problems, it is necessary to continue to increase its efficiency and innovate. Cardano will be an efficient social and financial operating system.

# What BitTorrent has done

BitTorrent is a communication protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing, which enables users to distribute data and electronic files over the Internet in a decentralized manner. To send or receive files, users use a BitTorrent client on their computer. Users who download and share files are part of the network and help distribute the data. There is no central server that can be targeted for attack or blocked. The way the network works is that users connect to other users who have a given file and download it from them. This decentralized nature makes it very difficult to impossible to stop BitTorrent as a whole. Such a network is essentially indestructible because no particular user is the critical point that provides data distribution. If one user were to be disconnected, other users can still communicate and distribute data among themselves.

The Summon Platform consists of open-source, on-chain (PlutusTx and Plutarch validation) code, off-chain computation code (written with Lucid and the cCrdano-transaction-lib) and server code that runs on the back-end, hosted by the Summon Platform. 

The Summon team will take advantage of open-source code being developed by the ADAO Community and other Cardano organizations, contributing to those repositories to advance the ecosystem.   

Summon will also develop off-chain code that will remain closed source to protect proprietary products, with other code being produced on a delayed, open-source model, as deemed appropriate.   Summon allows for users to create, update, and manage DAOs.

 It also allows for DAOs to manage other DAOs via a controlling stake, and will continue to operate with the highest  possible levels of interoperability.   This means that DAOs will not be operating in isolation, but instead can directly interact with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) systems in a variety of contexts, subject to certain criteria predetermined by the DAO.  

Some of the distinguishing elements of the Summon Platform include the ability to utilize different strategies to collect a return in DeFi, and having these strategies directly implemented into Plutus-Core validators.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

192,Is it necessary to revoke or limit smart contracts after using dapps on Cardano ? I noticed in my wallet it was possible to delete the dapp connection to a dex but I'm uncertain if that also revoked the smart contract.

Charli3 Oracles - In a direct response to the scaling issues plaguing Ethereum, #cardano  (ADA) was developed as a quicker, inexpensive, and more secure blockchain infrastructure.

ADA is also one of the only Blockchain projects that has been built via a peer-reviewed and researched based approach.  For an oracle built on Cardano this means the backbone of its network is built on a trusted, open source foundation adding another layer of trust for users.

Charli3 is the first decentralized oracle network for the Cardano blockchain. By being native to Cardano, Charli3 aims to avoid  the notable issues with flexibility, scaling, and growing transaction fees seen with Ethereum-based oracles while also building its foundation on a trusted network.",2023-04-25 22:00:55

&#x200B;

This is ErgoMinnow (maybe some of you will recognize me from twitter).

I'm just wanting to make a quick post letting you all know that the Rosen Bridge from Ergo to Cardano is now live with public testing taking place today!

You can use ADA and Hosky on Cardano and ERG and Comet on Ergo.

This bridge is open source, trustless and permissionless.

Please DYOR and KYA when using the bridge.

As to my understanding, one of the coolest things about Rosen is that it only utilizes Ergo's smart contracts which lowers the potential attack vector on the bridge. There is no need to worry about the security assumptions of the other chain it connects to (not that I think Cardano has poor security).

Look into it for yourselves folks! A lot of us in the Ergo community believe this could become the back-end hub of interoperability in the crypto space!

205,"Cardano's security is based on ADA coins' distribution and market value. This is based on the assumption that one entity cannot quickly and cheaply acquire a supermajority of all coins. The demand for ADA coins increases the market value, making a potential attack more expensive. There is one clever attack vector. It is possible to create a DeFi service offering a higher yield than delegators can get for staking ADA. For example, it could be a lending platform that offers a 10% yield for the ADA coins you provide to the service. Such a DeFi service would directly compete with staking. The service would siphon ADA from the staking and thus theoretically weaken the security of the PoS protocol. Can an attacker get the required number of ADA coins to attack in this way?

# TLDR

Trying to obtain a supermajority of PoS coins through the DeFi service is a theoretically possible attack, but very likely unfeasible in practice. The attack would be very costly and it would be necessary to create the most attractive service on the market.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

238,"The more blockchain networks are ready for mass adoption, the more community members will ask how to help projects get more people interested in and using them. People don't care about technological details or decentralization. Even the majority of the population doesn't think that fiat money is a problem that needs to be solved through cryptocurrencies or that replacing fiat money with cryptocurrencies will solve a country's specific problems. How to present Cardano, which is one of many other projects? From our point of view, it is time to show people how to solve specific problems and convince them of the benefits of moving to the blockchain. Within a few years, blockchain technology will be ready for mass adoption and disruption in many industries. The existence of technology does not necessarily mean that anyone will use it. The hardest step for Cardano will be to break into a real business. This essentially means disrupting current services and replacing or integrating with server-based applications. For this to happen, the people must demand it and the current gatekeepers must agree with the change. It makes sense to convince ordinary people of the opportunities Cardano offers, but alongside that, it is important to debate with businesses and governments.

# TLDR

DeFi is the best marketing for decentralization as it creates an alternative to existing financial services. Adoption by states and business is also important. Cardano has been adopted by the government in Ethiopia to build a decentralized identity and by Fortune 500 company Dish. Working use cases is also great marketing. Definitely better for the mass population than boring explanations of technological details.

241,"Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake revealed that the IP addresses of Ether stakers are monitored as part of a broader set of metadata as :
“deposit addresses, you can look at withdrawal addresses, you can look at fee recipients, you can look at IP addresses”

Does that also monitors IP-addresses as Metamask does now ?

ConsenSys, the team behind Ethereum wallet MetaMask, began collecting IP addresses in November. The policy amendment was made to ensure that the firm could comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies where necessary.

Possibility is high that Lace also collects the same IP-address info to comply with the KYC & AML policies .

Here is [the link to the full research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06014.pdf).

Personally, this is a mechanism I'd love to see implemented on Cardano ASAP after CIP-1694. Something like this needs to be in place before the market starts going ballistic again because there needs to be *some* prioritized transactions for Cardano to have serious DeFi. Trading IS time dependent. People need to have the ability for their trades to go through quickly. Tiered fees allows that to happen on Cardano while not excluding those that want to process a transaction with lower priority for a much lower and reasonable fee. This was an issue when Cardano DeFi first turned on in the peak of the previous market cycle (think SundaeSwap debacle...) and tiered fees will help prevent it from happening again.",2023-04-21 13:14:33

Project Catalyst is featured in the latest **Cardano Foundation Annual Report** published this past week. Thank you to everyone who has been part of the program and has helped shape Catalyst to what it is today.

 This is the latest update directly [from the Catalyst Circle](https://twitter.com/ProjectCCvX?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv) \- shared in their words:  


*""The Code of Conduct is the result of an extensive review process. We gathered valuable insights from previous Circle members and community input to create this document.*

*The insights we gathered served as a guide in formulating high-level expectations of ourselves and future Circle members. The Code of Conduct reflects the values and principles essential for Project Catalyst's success.*

*We recognize that our community consists of individuals with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Therefore, the Code of Conduct creates a safe and inclusive environment where all members can thrive, contribute, and grow.*

*We encourage everyone to read and understand the Code of Conduct, as our collective responsibility is to maintain a positive and respectful community. The Code of Conduct will also serve as a reference for anyone who wants to join the Circle in the future.*

*However, our work is far from over. We had our first official working session to outline our Bylaws, where you will see much more of the input gathered from previous Circle cohorts and the community. The Bylaws are much more in-depth than the Code Of Conduct. Our goal is to build the framework of expectations and responsibilities of Catalyst Circle members so that when our time concludes, we can smoothly transition to CCv5 and give the newly elected members a solid foundation to start from.*

*We understand that building a solid foundation for the future of Project Catalyst is essential, and we take this responsibility very seriously. We aim to ensure that the Catalyst Circle will continue to serve the Cardano community to the best of its abilities, inspiring and supporting projects that will advance the Cardano ecosystem.*

*Thank you for your continued support and dedication to Project Catalyst.""*

## Voltaire Musings - Workshop Maybe?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tswjjrhss7va1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=531c143de0f58af4d81d3c39f1eefdc53814a797

CIP-1694 marks the first iteration of Cardano’s on-chain governance. Given its importance, achieving broad consensus is vital as Cardano looks to the future. To make that happen, it’s equally important the community conducts its own governance discussions and events. 

The recent [Cardano governance workshop in Colorado](https://www.essentialcardano.io/video/cip-1694-community-workshop?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv) in early March, and a recap online event on 30th of March, are good examples of this collaboration. Led by key contributors and thought leaders in the community, both workshops sparked deep engagement and insight gathering, capturing inputs from a broad spectrum of community interests and experiences. Participants engaged in a range of collaborative activities and discussions to refine and debate the on-chain governance system proposed in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/JaredCorduan/CIPs/blob/voltaire-v1/CIP-1694/README.md?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-96X6Zm2xmnpGMBOPCD6iWTYV9vDVW4cyXo5WXPRyz5wRPAMZPhJjNeZrl-r7a-ITsTpbNv). The workshops were productive, established a model for future community events, and highlighted the importance of collaboration and inclusivity in governance frameworks. 

The conversations on CIP-1694 thus far are only the start. Today, a grant program is opening up to support community workshops across May, June, and July 2023. The global community events will be punctuated by two workshops held in Tokyo, Japan, and Edinburgh, Scotland during June and July co-hosted by EMURGO and IOG. Edinburgh's event in July will wrap up the year's workshops and bookend the feedback loop on CIP-1694 design. Dates for each co-hosted event will be announced in early May.

# Project Catalyst is looking ahead - Recap

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x9vu1uxws7va1.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af3481d49016526b93992410c9ea6c8f9bbfa477

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Couple weeks ago, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. Then, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting. Recently, in its first, we reviewed the Catalyst technology stack and the path ahead.

Catalyst funding rounds have been on pause for a little while now. Thank you everyone for your patience and continued support as we've navigated these past months. 2023 is shaping up to be an important year for Cardano, and equally so for Catalyst. You’ll be playing a pivotal role.

## Weekly GitHub Repo Round Up

&#x200B;

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems.

The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

276,"When I started learning about cryptocurrencies many years ago, one of the most strange opinions on social media was the claim that Bitcoin had no leader and that it was the best thing for decentralization. Some people even claimed that Bitcoin doesn't even have a team, or that Bitcoin is modified by anyone who wants to. As a programmer and expert in network protocols, I immediately knew this was nonsense. Yet to this day, many people still believe it. Charles Hoskinson and the IOG team are sometimes seen as the problem, but it's actually one of Cardano's greatest strengths. Most people in the cryptocurrency space don't understand decentralization. They don't know what a team can and cannot do with a running distributed network that is decentralized through coins or hash rate. The lay public may not know that every software in the world has a team of maintainers and a decision-maker. We will try to explain why a team of experts, scientists, and programmers is the best Cardano can have and how we will all benefit from it. 

# TLDR

The Cardano community should be proud of the IOG team and realize that the success of the project is dependent on the ability to improve blockchain technology and innovate. Unlike gold, problems of blockchain protocols can be solved. New features can be even added. If we want better money, it is comforting to know that we can improve a new financial system indefinitely.

# Why does blockchain need a team of maintainers?

There will forever be competition between blockchain projects. While this may stir emotions as people perceive it through the squabbles between communities, at a technological level it is an inevitable and even desirable phenomenon. Technological progress cannot be stopped. You can't say that a network protocol is done forever and will never need updating. It's just the opposite. For a protocol to remain relevant, it requires constant maintenance and keeping up with innovation. Obviously, the better protocols will win and the losers will be forgotten over time. It doesn't matter what your definition of better and worse is, because it's subjective. Some better form of an existing one will always replace its competitor because it is more effective at something. We all have this principle ingrained in us because it's how nature works. Whoever can better manage resources and adapt to new conditions in a given environment always wins.

278,"Hey,

I was wandering what you guys think about the general UX state of wallets in general and specifically in the Cardano ecosystem.

I have been in crypto for over a decade and it seems like wallet UX hasn‘t fundamentally improved. I have tried many, but at the end of the day they all have a different UI. 

I really like and support the idea of self-custodial wallets and there are some good ideas floating around how that weird feeling can be removed. 

Cardano is leading on so many fronts. For better adoption UX is key though. 

Any thoughts?",2023-04-20 07:33:05

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

290,"# Introduction

**Cardano is an open-source blockchain project that was launched in 2017 to address the challenges of existing blockchains and develop a more balanced and sustainable ecosystem that better meets the needs of its users.**

# The Evolution of Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology has evolved from the **first generation (e.g., Bitcoin)** that provided secure cryptocurrency transfer to the **second generation (e.g., Ethereum)** that offered enhanced solutions for smart contract execution and application development. However, second-generation blockchains often face issues in scalability.

# Cardano: A Third-Generation Blockchain

**Cardano is considered a third-generation blockchain that combines the features of previous generations while evolving to meet the changing needs of users.** To ensure the highest security, scalability, and functionality, Cardano focuses on three core concepts: scalability, interoperability, and sustainability.

# Scalability

Scalability is crucial in ensuring that the Cardano network can process an increasing number of transactions as user demand grows. It provides higher bandwidth capabilities, allowing transactions to carry a significant amount of supportive data that can be easily managed within the network. **Cardano uses various techniques such as data compression and is working to introduce Hydra, which will enable multiple side-chain functionality.**

# Interoperability

Interoperability ensures a **multi-functional environment for financial, business, or commercial operations by enabling users to interact with multiple currencies across various blockchains.** Cardano is being developed to support cross-chain transfers, multiple token types, and commonly used smart contract languages.

# Sustainability

Sustainability is essential to ensure that the system is self-sustainable. To drive growth and maturity in a truly decentralized manner, **Cardano is built to allow the community to maintain its continuous development by participating, proposing, and implementing system improvements.** The treasury system is controlled by the community and is refilled constantly from potential sources such as newly-minted coins being held back as funding, a percentage of stake pool rewards, and transaction fees.

&#x200B;

# Advantages of Cardano

Cardano offers several advantages over other blockchain projects. It uses formal methods, such as mathematical specifications, property-based tests, and proofs, to achieve strong guarantees on the functional correctness of core components of the system. **Cardano is written in Haskell, a secure functional programming language, and employs powerful methods for ensuring correctness of the code.** The Ouroboros protocol establishes rigorous security guarantees and was delivered with **several peer-reviewed papers presented in top-tier cybersecurity and cryptography conferences.**

**Cardano is energy-efficient as it is a proof-of-stake blockchain.** In contrast to proof-of-work blockchains, **Cardano requires much less energy and computational power, making it a more sustainable solution.** Cardano also handles upgrades differently than traditional blockchains, using a hard-fork combinator technology that ensures a smooth transition to a new protocol without erasing the previous history.

Decentralization is also a fundamental feature of Cardano. **It is maintained by** [**almost 3,000 distributed stake pools**](https://cexplorer.io/pool) **that are operated by the community.** All blocks and transactions are validated by network participants without any reliance on a centralized authority.

Finally, Cardano offers a functional environment for business use cases, providing a foundation for global decentralized finance to develop a range of DApps that can run using functional and domain-specific smart contracts, providing multi-asset tokens for any needs.

# Staking in Cardano

**Staking is a critical component of Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols, which allows users to earn rewards by holding and maintaining a certain amount of cryptocurrency in their wallets.** In PoS, the concept of staking refers to the process of locking a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral to become eligible to participate in the consensus process and validate transactions. In return, stakers earn rewards proportional to their stake, providing an incentive toto maintain the network and discourage malicious behavior. **The amount of reward a staker can earn depends on various factors, including the size of their stake, the length of time they've been staking, and the overall network participation rate.**

In addition to earning rewards, staking offers several benefits to network participants. For one, **stakers can help to increase the security and stability of the network by providing a more decentralized and distributed infrastructure.** By participating in the consensus process, stakers have a direct say in the governance and decision-making of the network, making it more democratic and transparent. **Furthermore, staking offers a more energy-efficient alternative to PoW protocols, as it eliminates the need for resource-intensive mining operations.**

# Conclusion

Cardano has emerged as one of the **best blockchain projects due to its focus on scalability, interoperability, and sustainability.** It offers several **advantages over other blockchain projects, including energy efficiency, decentralization, and formal methods for ensuring correctness.**

Cardano's Proof of Stake protocol **provides stakers with the ability to earn rewards while maintaining the network and making it more secure and stable.** With its emphasis on functional smart contracts and multi-asset tokens, Cardano is well-positioned to support a wide range of decentralized finance applications. **The unique features of Cardano make it a strong contender in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology.**

291,"The University of Edinburgh is going to measure the decentralization of blockchain projects and provide this information through an index (EDI). It will start with Bitcoin and continue with other relevant projects, i.e. Ethereum, Cardano, etc. The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) may thus become the first relevant source of truth when it comes to the degree of decentralization of individual blockchain projects. This is very important, as ordinary people may have no idea how difficult it can be to compare the quality of decentralization between projects. Blockchain communities have endless arguments about which project is the most decentralized. This information is also useful for regulators who can make evidence-based decisions based on the index. EDI can give us a very precise answer to the question of how well Cardano is decentralized compared to other projects. How can it turn out?

# TLDR

Cardano is the most decentralized network in the top 10 when it comes to the number of significant nodes in the network (block producers) and the holders of the expensive resource. Decentralization of PoS networks has improved slightly over the last six months while Bitcoin decentralization has been steadily declining for roughly 10 years. 

# Myths and Reality

One of the most widespread misconceptions in the blockchain industry is the assumption that the quality of decentralization depends on the number of nodes in the network. The blockchain network consists of distributed nodes that can be operated by anyone without the permission of a third party. However, the number of nodes in the network has only a marginal effect on the quality of decentralization. The main task of a distributed network is to distribute data (transactions and blocks) between nodes and share resources. The number of nodes in the network affects the efficiency of data distribution and availability. It also affects the reliability and availability of the network. It is almost impossible for data to be lost from the world if it exists on thousands of nodes and is constantly available. Each newly connected node is able to find peers and start communication at any time. The network cannot simply be shut down because there is no center (server).

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

You then would allow the holder of some NFT to decrypt and read the message, ideally even amend the message according to some predefined rules (maximum number of allowed characters).

I can think of an off-chain setup, where the user connects their wallet and the content of a website that I have created only is visible, when the connected wallet holds the NFT, but that isn't quite as sexy - it would allow the website admin to cheat and change the rules at anytime.",2023-04-18 18:54:32

311,"Occasionally, Cardano FUD appears and people ask if this project deserves to have such a high capitalization and be in the top 10. I believe that blockchain projects are not here to fight among themselves for a higher market capitalization, but to provide utility to people. What is useful is decided by each individual according to their needs. Is the second largest social network less useful or less relevant than the one in the first place? It would be very foolish to claim this. Technology development is not a sport, so there is no need to compare success by rank. Blockchain development does not have a fixed goal but is a continuous process. The same can be said for the adoption of cryptocurrencies and the use of blockchain in the financial and other sectors. The ranking will constantly change and that's okay. So is ranking a completely irrelevant metric? You can't say that. So what does market capitalization ranking suggest?

# TLDR

The ranking is a reflection of many different factors and subjective reasons of those who hold the coins of blockchain projects. The adoption of blockchain is still at the beginning and everything can change quite fundamentally depending on many external events. Almost nothing can be predicted with a high degree of certainty. Still, we can conclude that Cardano deserves to be in the top 10 and there are many relevant reasons for that. The main reasons are liquid staking, decentralization, community, and the Plutus platform.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

332,"People don't see the Internet as an endless tangle of network protocols, but as a place where they can work, communicate and have fun. They say blockchain is going to change the Internet and we've even started calling it Web3. The idea of Web3 has one major problem. Should the backbone for Web3 be Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, or something else? Most people believe the future will be multi-chain. The team building the Lace wallet plans to support multiple blockchains, and it is very likely that Bitcoin and Ethereum will also be supported. Lace Wallet is not the first attempt in this area, but thanks to the IOG team there is a good chance that it will be one of the first to be reliable, secure, support many blockchains, and gain popularity among users. Lace can be a single gateway to Web3 for you. Users may not even know that the services they use run on many blockchains. The blockchain industry needs a multi-chain wallet for the next wave of adoption, and Cardano may have an advantage if Lace is it. 

# TLDR

Centralized exchange and lending platforms are multi-chain services with a multitude of custodial wallets. People use them because they can access many blockchains through a single account. If Lace Wallet offers similar services, decentralization will win. Bitcoiners can switch to Lace Wallet if they want to use DeFi services and thus they gain access to the Cardano ecosystem. Lace can onboard cryptocurrency users into the Cardano ecosystem if it offers what they want, which is security, simplicity, and the availability of a large number of services in one place.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Ledger live which I barley use had my Ada balance wrong at almost 10k ada I only have 7kish but I fixed it by clearing the cache in live. 

Now Lace has almost everything wrong, lower balance, not all token, even the wrong stake pool. I fixed the stake pool, and the balance is almost right but missing some according to Externl and Ledger.

343,"Okay, maybe not impossible, but it seems that none of the crypto tax tools have any support for Cardano NFT sales. I've tried several including Koinly, which is supposedly one of the best. A lot of these tools claim NFT support, but it's only for big (non CNFT) marketplaces like OpenSea. I minted and sold a lot of NFTs last year, and don't even know where to begin on how to calculate the taxes on them. Makes me want to give up, throw my ledger in a lake, and pretend I never got involved in CNFTs in the first place. If anyone has any else has found themselves in a similar situation, I'd appreciate any advice.",2023-04-16 19:32:53

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


Weekly round up of all things Catalyst (+more) is here. Recently, we saw several teams present their close out projects. First was MLABS with [their CTL Blockfrost Backend](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xk-FRLQT6v8?feature=share&t=601). Second, DLT360 team came back to wrap up highlights of [their six Fund7 proposals](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xk-FRLQT6v8?feature=share&t=1309) catering to onboarding industries into platforms. This week we also learned more from Simon at DirectEd Foundation that [is bootstrapping donations](https://www.youtube.com/live/Mz1GEHwh2wE?feature=share&t=315) in education in Africa. Additionally, dcSpark has [done some outstanding job](https://www.youtube.com/live/Mz1GEHwh2wE?feature=share&t=1261) with legislative outreach in the US.  


Lastly, we’ve also checked out brilliant work done on creating onboarding playbooks into the ecosystem as well as looking at the wider impact lead generating opportunities. Catch [the segments here](https://www.youtube.com/live/Mz1GEHwh2wE?feature=share&t=1725). Thank you for your great work and we wish you great strides ahead.   


A week ago, we also welcomed Catalyst's [Lead Architect - Steven Johnson](https://twitter.com/SJCatalyst) who gave an end to end presentation on the Catalyst technology stack and road ahead. [Very much worth the watch](https://www.youtube.com/live/Xk-FRLQT6v8?feature=share&t=2189).

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Two weeks ago, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. A week ago, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting. Last Wednesday, in its first, we've reviewed the Catalyst technology stack and the path ahead.

# Voltaire Musings

https://preview.redd.it/bmvnkj4druta1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=06a976c2c63f88012b1e56921b29ef613869ef28

Conversations around Governance at large continue speeding up. Have you had a chance to participate yet? There are some opportunities for you.  


CIP-1694 is a crucial step in Cardano’s journey into the age of Voltaire, defining the future on-chain governance mechanisms of the blockchain, and helping to create a self-sustaining system built on community contribution and consensus. Matthias Benkort (Cardano Foundation) along with Addie Girouard, Jared Corduan, & Kevin Hammond (IOG) recently filmed a useful explainer video with an overview and discussion on CIP-1694.  


In it, they discuss community-driven enhancements to the current governance scheme, the future roles and responsibilities of Delegate Representatives, the Constitutional Committee, and Stake Pool Operators, how to define and safeguard Cardano’s guiding principles. And current thinking on the tooling and governance processes needed to get there.  


Take a deeper dive [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obFeC2JS_IQ) with an explainer video.  


Wish to dive even deeper? A great place to start is by diving into the [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal, or catch the latest with the community initiative - Voltaire News! - [a collaborative community newsletter](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news) started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.

Mike played with some AI and came up with a very fun tool dubbed as Voltaire assistant. While limited in its functionality - a wonderful exercise in what could be the future of communication in difficult subjects.

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/mdjh3z7kruta1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dc694c2f73d011dd7bdb46bd7554567e3e6d5531

One of this year’s primary objectives has been to help educate the community on the technical functionality required to run Catalyst. Part of that mission has been to increase transparency in the backend systems. Of course, with this comes the need to continue community collaboration, and we’re hoping to see members champion community co-creation as they help to build and suggest improvements to these systems.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

Previously covered, but still interesting:

1. Charles dropped a video on Markets and Contagion in which he revealed that Credit Suisse wouldn’t allow an account when he was with Ethereum b/c crypto was “too risky.” Bwahahahaha. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1637952165217185792](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1637952165217185792)

3. Super ironic that the Credit Suisse CEO claimed crypto was in a bubble at $7k BTC. How the tables have turned. [https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1637783982271082496](https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1637783982271082496)

7. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)
8. Apparently, Sushi Swap DAO and its “Head Chef” just got served with an SEC subpoena and they’re asking the community for a $3 million defense fund (with potential for more). [https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813](https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813)
9. The crypto twitter meme response to the Sushi SEC subpoena was fast and brutal. [https://twitter.com/trhistorianelt/status/1638231852619104256](https://twitter.com/trhistorianelt/status/1638231852619104256)

11. Very interesting rumors that projects are sitting on 2-300 SEC subpoenas and dozens of Wells Notices. [https://coinpedia.org/ripple/xrp-price-have-the-xrp-bulls-and-whales-given-up-ahead-of-the-summary-judgment/](https://coinpedia.org/ripple/xrp-price-have-the-xrp-bulls-and-whales-given-up-ahead-of-the-summary-judgment/)
12. The IRS is asking for comments on NFTs as “collectibles” (apparently matters for long term capital gains and elsewhere). [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf)
13. Sebastian Nagel reports they have a Hydra head open on Cardano Mainnet. [https://twitter.com/ch1bo\_/status/1638599596782899205](https://twitter.com/ch1bo_/status/1638599596782899205)
14. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action. Basically, the SEC has launched its full war against crypto. [https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184)

16. Brian Armstrong says the Wells Notice is focused on staking and asset listings. [https://twitter.com/brian\_armstrong/status/1638654192138199041](https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1638654192138199041)
17. Kraken is also not having a great day. Operation Chokepoint 2.0! [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1638636382305546243](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1638636382305546243)
18. Report: The SEC is suing Justin Sun over TRX wash trading. Jake Paul and other celebrities are also being drug into the suit. [https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/22/tron-founder-justin-sun-sued-by-us-sec-on-securities-market-manipulation-charges/](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/22/tron-founder-justin-sun-sued-by-us-sec-on-securities-market-manipulation-charges/)

21. IOG dropped a recap of the CIP-1694 workshop. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1639030606100332545](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1639030606100332545)
22. Emurgo signed an MOU with Pan-Atlantic University in Nigeria to support blockchain education and research. [https://twitter.com/wlstylr/status/1638989199583088641](https://twitter.com/wlstylr/status/1638989199583088641)
23. The US is trying to kill crypto. Hong Kong is investing millions in building a crypto hub. [https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1638499378691293185](https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1638499378691293185)
24. Report: Montenegro caught and arrested Do Kwon! [https://twitter.com/filip\_adzic/status/1638886164118802432](https://twitter.com/filip_adzic/status/1638886164118802432)
25. Here’s Caitlin Long on the Banking Crisis. She is absolutely the most knowledgeable person on banking in crypto. If there is anyone I would trust on banking matters, it would be her. [https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU](https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU)
26. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI)
27. Wow. Did Cointelegraph really try to claim we have no self-custody in Cardano staking? [https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616](https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616)
28. Coinbase is updating its staking services (including those related to ADA) and says it will “acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol.” [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards)
29. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at. [https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/](https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/)
30. People are divided on whether GPT4 will swallow everything and if any skill matters right now other than prompt engineering. But, it looks like Cardano smart contract development is definitely on the radar for that conversation. [https://twitter.com/PoolShamrock/status/1639748637684105217](https://twitter.com/PoolShamrock/status/1639748637684105217)
31. The disparity in daily users between the fledgling defi projects in Cardano and the largest most established defi projects in crypto is shocking to some. [https://twitter.com/SubcriticalTV/status/1640058128300638208](https://twitter.com/SubcriticalTV/status/1640058128300638208)

33. People are very curious about how the CFTC knew what Signal text chains were on CZ’s phone. [https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1640400690349744128](https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1640400690349744128)
34. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC. [https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1640371206644703232](https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1640371206644703232)
35. CFTC alleges some bad facts based on internal chat logs. [https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1640479998049124353](https://twitter.com/ArmySpies/status/1640479998049124353)

40. Here’s the Cooper & Kirk memo itself. [cooperkirk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Operation-Choke-Point-2.0.pdf](http://cooperkirk.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Operation-Choke-Point-2.0.pdf)

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-04-14 05:30:11
372,"Those that attended  the Cardano Summit 2021 were eligible to receive a series of collectibles that were dropped on Terra Virtua. 

If I am not mistaken, these collectibles worked as a ticket that granted its holders a chance to later receive a Cardano Summit 2021 NFTs minted on the Cardano blockchain.

Does anyone know what happened to these NFTs? Were they minted and distributed as announced?",2023-04-14 01:34:58

In addition to all of that, they have shown significant progress, they have launched products with real adoption in the Cardano blockchain, and they are constantly innovating and launching new products and features such as non-custodial yield farming.

376,"So I made a newbie mistake and went NFT shopping without giving too much sort about privacy.

First: all NFTs I bought ended up in the same wallet - kind of obvious, because I didn't bother to use different wallets.

Second: Even though I used a HD wallet, on [jpg.store](https://jpg.store) I could see my wallet as the holder of all the NFTs I bought. First question: Does this have to be so? What is the reason? I understand that NFTs are linked to addresses, but in a HD wallet I can generate new addresses and each NFT could be linked to an individual address.

I understand that there is still the buying history on the blockchain. E.g. I fund a wallet with 100 ADA, I buy 4 NFTs for 25 ADA each, the purchase would still link the NFTs to one single address.

Third: Being the newb I am I than create more wallets and distributed my NFTs. My idea was: I can make the correlation between all the NFTs a bit less obvious at least.

\----

And now to my surprise, trying Cardano Scan and Cardano Explorer and [pool.pm](https://pool.pm), I \*\*was not\*\* able to start with the asset ID of one NFT, retrace the transactions I did to then find all the other NFTs.

Could it be that it's not possible to link one address to another by looking at transaction on the cardano blockchain?

I am well versed in Bitcoin but new to Cardano. If someone is willing to tell me what's going on, I don't mind technical details or just links to relevant documentation. I googled before asking here, but what I found left me more confused.",2023-04-13 17:25:11

378,"In the latest update vid by CH, he briefly mentioned that PLutus V3 is in the works.

As we know, V2 was the Vasil hard fork update, bringing collateral outputs, reference scripts/inputs and maybe few other things i don't remember.

I wonder what V3 is going to be about. Anyone has any info, or rumors what it could bring?

Maybe have a look through the current CIPs, to see if any of them are dealing with Plutus...?

When I quickly scrolled through the proposed CIPs, I've only seen these three CIPs about Plutus:

[https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip49/](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip49/) \- ECDSA and Schnorr signatures in Plutus Core

[https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip58/](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip58/) \- Plutus Bitwise Primitives

(the 381 link on the [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://cips.cardano.org/) page is missing a 0, need to use my edited link)

There are also more Plutus-related CIPs that are still under review, but those are probably not nearly ready for release yet.",2023-04-13 13:19:28

381,"Paima Studio designed a blockchain game engine called Paima Engine. One of the most exciting concepts the team has created is Stateful NFTs. Most people view non-fungible tokens as an image linked to a token on the blockchain. Stateful NFT is a revolutionary concept linking a token to a dynamically changing state. Stateful NFT can store time, in-game experience, earned items or in-game money, etc. It can be seen as an account or a saved game position. I personally believe that this concept has potential outside of the gaming industry.

# TLDR

Scarcity itself is often meaningless without utility. The value of most current coins or tokens is based on artificially created scarcity. Stateful NFTs can store time, history, experience, luck, and similar things. This can be a game utility that players will really enjoy.

[https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1637952165217185792](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1637952165217185792)

7. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)
8. Apparently, Sushi Swap DAO and its “Head Chef” just got served with an SEC subpoena and they’re asking the community for a $3 million defense fund (with potential for more). [https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813](https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813)

14. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action. Basically, the SEC has launched its full war against crypto. [https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184)

26. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI)
27. Wow. Did Cointelegraph really try to claim we have no self-custody in Cardano staking? [https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616](https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616)
28. Coinbase is updating its staking services (including those related to ADA) and says it will “acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol.” [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards)
29. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at. [https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/](https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/)

34. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC. [https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1640371206644703232](https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1640371206644703232)

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

I was under the impression that lace would be able to run as a downloadable application that could run without the need for a browser. Is it much more challenging? I would love to see an application that operates like ToS(thinkorswim) in the cardano ecosystem, and I was hoping lace would be moving in that direction of things.

392,"Would you like to improve the Cardano protocol? There is a process for doing this called Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Through the CIP process, you can create a document in which you can describe the problem and propose a solution. CIPs should serve as the primary mechanism for proposing changes to the Cardano protocol. It is where authors, CIP editors, and the community meet. They can all debate the proposal. Proposals are usually submitted by experts and expertise is also expected from reviewers. If anyone is interested in detailed technological information, CIP documents can be a useful resource. People are sometimes confused and don't know how the CIP process and on-chain governance are related. The introduction of on-chain governance is proposed in CIP-1694. Let's take a look at it.

# TLDR

There is no direct connection between the current CIP process and the on-chain governance proposal as described in CIP-1694. However, CIP documents could serve as input for governance in the future. CIP documents would contain technical details about the problem and the ideal expert-approved solution.

29. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

409,"Cardano has 1.23B ADA coins in its project treasury. Every 5 days, 0.3% is taken from the reserve (currently about 9.32B) together with collected fees and both are used for the epoch reward. From this amount, 20% is taken and put into the treasury. That's roughly 5.5M ADA every epoch. As the reserve declines, so do the contributions to the treasury. It is expected that in the future the income from the reserve will be gradually replaced by the income from fees. Currently, roughly 20k ADA goes into the treasury each epoch from the fees collected. Cardano should be an ecosystem that will be able to finance itself. This way it can maintain its independence from VC funds and can remain in the hands of the community. ADA in the treasury belongs to the community, i.e. all Cardano stakeholders. Each ADA holder can decide what projects the treasury will fund.

# TLDR

The quality of decentralization is currently judged only by the number of pools, delegators, and validators. In the near future, we will be looking more and more at the quality of decentralization at the project management level, as people will be more interested in finding solutions to problems (like the security budget problem). People don't yet realize how important the project treasury is for decentralizing the blockchain and that the team needs to be in the role of employee, not a ruler.

14. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

29. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

34. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused).

415,"So I've been watching the MAV and the % of delegated for each stake pool group and there has been a big change.

The Minimum Attack Vector, or MAV, sometimes known as the Nakamoto Coefficient (depending on who you ask) determines the minimum number of groups of Stake Pools that would need for block production to be compromised. It's been a while since it has been at 31. Last week i'm sure it was 26/27 or there about.

[https://cexplorer.io/nakamoto](https://cexplorer.io/nakamoto)

Similarly, both Binance and Avengers stake pools have decreased drastically in amount staked. They used to be well over 10% and are now under 9/8%. It looks like there has been a redistribution of staked amounts.

Not only that, it won't let me install anything else on my computer due to size constraints. I want it gone. This snuck up on me, but I never got a chance to unstake my ADA. 

My question is this - what happens if I delete Daedalus? Am I able to spend this ADA I currently have? I don't appear to have been accumulating staying rewards, but I'm not sure if that's something that only displays in Daedalus. Obviously I don't want Daedalus to brick my computer, but I don't want to risk losing anything either. What's the best solution here?

I one point I did see the status of the transaction on my wallet say failed but then it changed to high and completed. The ADA is no longer even on my robinhood account. I know 77 ADA isnt much but dont want something like this to happen when I send more ADA in the future.

442,"Hi all,

I'm about to undergo my regular Windows reinstallation and I've been doing some research into what is required to move Daedalus. 

So, I've found a few bits, but just wanted to clarify - you know, given the potential risks.

I have Daedalus on my PC which I'm backing up (so I don't have to re-sync the whole blockchain again). My keys are secured on a Nano X which is synced and staked via Daedalus. I've noticed that my Rewards are associated to a 'Rewards Address'. 

Validation Questions are:

1. Having read a few bits of information, because my keys are safely stored on my Nano, I don't have to worry too much about that - is that correct?
2. As I don't have my keys stored on the Daedalus wallet, I don't have to worry about the seed phrase for that - correct?

Question I've not found an answer to yet (above two are more a validation of my understanding) is:

3. What am I doing with my Unspent Rewards? It says that it is in my Ledger Nano X on the left hand column of the Rewards tab, but then if I open Ledger Live, the amount of ADA I have in my wallet is 'off' by the amount in the Rewards Address. Do I have to transfer this?",2023-04-08 16:31:48

16. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

23. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

45. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

50. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

465,"Who should decide who Cardano should have served best? Many people would answer that no one because a decentralized network should have no leader. They believe that the blockchain should be launched and then no major changes made. Another possibility is that all users who have skin in the game will make the decisions. Through democratic voting, they can collectively decide to change the protocol. One group may benefit from the changes, but the other may lose. The change may, in principle, satisfy only some, so it may cause an exodus of some users. Cardano will have on-chain governance. Let's think about what approach is most appropriate. Is Cardano heading in the right direction? 

**TLDR**

* Teams have essentially launched not only blockchains but also movements or communities of sorts.
* A protocol capable of change may suit the majority, but minorities may go elsewhere. 
* A change-resistant protocol cannot respond to changes in the external environment. It will either survive as it is or cease to exist. 
* The community needs to trust the protocol, and the only way to do that is to control it.
* As opinions differ on what the mission of the Cardano project actually is, opinions will differ on what new features to implement or how to improve the protocol.
* The mission of Cardano is linked to wider adoption, and so we do well to rely on the wisdom of the crowd.

How is this done for SHEN? Is there also an oracle that tracks prices on various exchanges? There are only a few exchanges listing SHEN, so I can't imagine that's the way it works. Is it the smart contract himself that calculates the price for SHEN (based on what?) and thereby the exchanges follow that price by arbitrageurs?",2023-04-05 07:31:08

33. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

40. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

47. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

62. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

67. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

493,"Are ADA holders just investors, or something more? Everyone can view it subjectively. Some are just pragmatic investors, some are investors and fans. Is there any other category? I'm sure there is. Someone can be more than just a fan. There is a group of people who see Cardano as an opportunity to create an alternative financial system and are actively involved in building it. It doesn't matter if they are developers, those who actively participate in social media debates or comment on CIPs. They can also be those who follow what's going on in the Cardano ecosystem. They are also those who use DeFi services. If you accept the fact that the financial system, or money if you like, is one of the pillars of states, we should think about what Cardano can become. If cryptocurrencies are to weaken the position of states, it is logical that people need to create some alternative. Is it too bold to think that new groups of people can emerge from decentralized networks that are more than just a community of fans? Can they call themselves citizens, for example? Let's flesh out these ideas more.

# TLDR

* Blockchain is more than just a protocol and a native coin. It's also a community. A community can be more than just a group of fans. It can be the basis for a new society. 
* Futurologists predict that corporations can replace states. Blockchain networks like Cardano are a better platform for replacing states than corporations. 
* Cardano will allow decision-making power to be distributed among all ADA holders. Money doesn't have to be a tool of the state, but a tool of the people to determine how the rules should be set.
* Success is not about individuals getting a financial boost from a profitable investment, but about the collective being committed enough to strive for change.

27. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

33. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

40. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

[https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813](https://forum.sushi.com/t/establish-sushi-legal-defense-fund/11813)

47. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action. Basically, the SEC has launched its full war against crypto. [https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184)

59. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI)
60. Wow. Did Cointelegraph really try to claim we have no self-custody in Cardano staking? [https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616](https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616)
61. Coinbase is updating its staking services (including those related to ADA) and says it will “acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol.” [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards)
62. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at. [https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/](https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-moves-to-on-chain-staking-for-tezos-cosmos-solana-and-cardano/)

67. Some are already implying that the CFTC alleging a coin is a commodity in an enforcement action may be a long term blessing in disguise for crypto since at least it’s not the SEC.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-04-04 05:30:10

498,"The 1694 Constitutional Committee nomination process is essential for upholding the democratic principles that should guide our community. Upon reviewing the list of nominees [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHLsDptxCGURPyf9hSXvAwVtg9m-45g8VSS7l5g6d3E/edit#), I feel compelled to express my concerns regarding the variety of nominees and the reliance on a single platform for the nomination process.

My main suggestion to improve the situation would be to involve an external organization to conduct a thorough audit of our nomination process. This way, we can ensure that it is both transparent and equitable for all participants. After all, with the technology at our disposal, there is no excuse for failing to guarantee a fair and open process.

Additionally, to foster a more decentralized governance structure, it is vital to extend the nomination process to various platforms, rather than just relying on Twitter or any other closed platform. While Twitter is widely used, it would be more beneficial to include decentralized platforms like Mastodon in the process. By doing so, we can ensure a more inclusive and transparent nomination process that fairly represents the community's diverse perspectives.

Although expanding the nomination process to multiple platforms might present challenges in consolidating responses, the benefits of inclusivity and fairness outweigh these difficulties. In order to maintain impartiality, it is necessary not to tip the scales by favoring one platform over another.

By addressing these concerns and working together, we can achieve a more democratic and decentralized governance system, creating a stronger and more resilient community for the future.

499,"Hi, I'm fairly new to the space. In fact, I just learned that Cardano existed 10 minutes ago. It was 2 minutes ago finding this sub that I learned that Cardano probably isn't a hacking/scamming organization. Let me explain.

Today I woke up to one of my favorite youtube channels (Angela's Symposium) taken over a supposed ""Cardano Foundation"". It has since been reclaimed by it's owners, but in the interim the channel was renamed and used to promote various dubious transactions. Looking through this sub, it seems like this is a thing that is known to occur, and that the position of the community here that while these are scams they are unrelated to the real Cardano. 

I would encourage the community here to consider that as long as outsiders like myself are more likely to come across actual hackers and scammers using this name than the real Cardano it may be difficult to amass the legitimacy and trust necessary for a project such as this. 

The imposters are still out there; a reputation is far FAR easier to lose than it is to earn back.",2023-04-03 21:40:50

It  also has problems pairing with cold wallets. One of my biggest regrets in crypto if not the single biggest regret was to had moved my ADA to Daedalus back in 2020. Now it is been a journey of patience and alot of pain just to access it. Do yourself a favor and stay very far away from this wallet unless you are some sort of masochist,2023-04-03 22:11:38
501,"This is my goal and this is why.

 

1. Increase Brand Awareness: By exhibiting at non-crypto events, you can introduce Cardano to people who may not be familiar with cryptocurrencies. This can increase brand awareness and help Cardano reach a broader audience.
2. Targeted Audience: Depending on the type of event, you may be able to reach a targeted audience that is interested in topics related to blockchain, finance, or technology. This can provide an opportunity to educate potential users about the benefits of Cardano and how it can be used.
3. Networking Opportunities: Non-crypto events can be an excellent opportunity to meet people who may be interested in partnering with or investing in Cardano. By exhibiting at these events, you can connect with potential partners, investors, and other industry professionals.
4. Industry Insights: Attending non-crypto events can provide valuable insights into trends and innovations in other industries. This can help Cardano stay informed about the latest developments and potentially identify opportunities for collaboration or expansion.

27. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

33. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

62. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-04-03 05:30:10

My question is, if it is possible to consolidate the balances of several Cardano/ADA addresses in a single address, or if there are any implications in this regard.

Honestly, I'm kind of ignorant of these things (I even tried to transfer my ADA to a single address, but it still charge fees for network usage, unlike an exchange, and yes, I've held off asking this question for quite some time, a bit embarrassing, but I still think other new users can learn from it).

Thank you very much for the clarifications.

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


Weekly round up of all things Catalyst (+more) is here. This week is especially exciting because the Catalyst team was able to share the second installment of proposed changes signaled for Fund10, specifically around Challenge Setting. We also saw  two amazing presentations discussing  [Auditability](https://www.youtube.com/live/PDqfSAf8m68?feature=share&t=1447) and [Nation Building Dapps](https://www.youtube.com/live/PDqfSAf8m68?feature=share&t=638). Congratulations to both Challenge Teams on completing the work and resurfacing some fantastic insights about projects funded under those topics. However, there's a lot more.  


So what's the latest? Let's dive right in.

# Project Catalyst is looking ahead 

https://preview.redd.it/n9131mrktira1.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=72cdd18eed6a28df339a17fa3fe3662d8b9e2842

Since Fund9’s end, the Catalyst team has been deep in research, discovery, and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media, and beyond.  


There are a number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. Last week, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst. This week, we turned our collective attention to Challenge Setting.

# Voltaire Musings

https://preview.redd.it/hznkmbkytira1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=27066196773390918964183b6bca6fa209311641

Conversations around Governance at large continue speeding up. Have you had a chance to participate yet? There are some opportunities for you.  


A great place to start is by diving into the [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal, or catch the latest with the community initiative - Voltaire News! - [a collaborative community newsletter](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news) started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.  


Additionally, following on from the earlier [CIP-1694 workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWm0S_H_Qyw) in Colorado, the organizing team held a public workshop on zoom earlier this week and [collaborated on the Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMYXJ3wU=/?moveToWidget=3458764550404064954&cot=14). Stay tuned for the recording, which will be published soon. A lot more of these events are expected to take place in the near future.

# LATAM taking lead! 

https://preview.redd.it/ohpv6t02uira1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02b8e2232bafef9d0dcec0dfb690d16567aadacd

As you may recall, there's a standing call to action to the community on the topic of organizing Voltaire workshops from the success of the first one held in Colorado. LATAM community is taking the lead and has put up a call to action. If you are in the region or wish to participate, make sure to check them out.  


The "" LATAM CIP 1694 Workshops "" are a series of meetings that will take place in different LATAM cities, simultaneously, to work on the CIP-1694 (Cardano Governance Document). Each city will write a document, which will be compiled into one proposal as a Latino Community in English. These Workshops seek to put LATAM on the map and raise our voice to the global Cardano community.  


Do you wish to host one of these local meetings in the region? You can find the sign up form here: [https://forms.gle/SY6KqdMcsWKjkLs66](https://forms.gle/SY6KqdMcsWKjkLs66)

There would be no Cardano, much less even Catalyst, without dedicated community members around the globe.  


One of the shining examples are countless initiatives from different town hall teams. Recently, Africa Town Hall celebrated their 1st anniversary. What an achievement! Big kudos to everyone who has helped make this a reality and continues supporting ongoing efforts for education and adoption.  


Thank you, sincerely.  


Now, make sure to soak up their energy from the latest [town hall recording celebrations here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6Sfl8XXE2U) You can also follow their work now [on twitter here](https://twitter.com/africa_townhall).

# Ariob Incubator Demo Day

https://preview.redd.it/208yytv5uira1.png?width=1752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=198fcc692ad696808dba3f40958913f71f39f3ea

On behalf of Input Output Global (IOG) and Iceaddis, we invite you to join us for the Ariob Incubator’s first Demo Day! Join us on Tuesday, April 4th at 4 p.m. UTC for the Ariob Incubator’s inaugural Demo Day.  


Last year, Project Catalyst launched the Ariob Incubator program in collaboration with Iceaddis, a pan-African incubator, and accelerator. This event is your opportunity to learn and directly connect with cutting-edge Web3 projects building on Cardano, many likely looking for additional guidance, support, or investment.  


The Ariob accelerator program is designed to elevate the most promising and impactful startups that initially found funding through Project Catalyst, whose primary focus is tackling real-life challenges across Africa. This five-month program has helped eight early-stage ventures refine their businesses and prepare for a select audience to mark the completion of the program.  


We look forward to showing you what we’ve been working on!! Learn more about Ariob: [https://ariob.io](https://ariob.io/) or catch this live stream placeholder link: [https://iohk.link/3KmpIvW](https://iohk.link/3KmpIvW)

# Last week in CIPs 

https://preview.redd.it/hbl5t7gauira1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d4a2fcbd863f006f570fb5eee469ddbbfb433c3f

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If you’re unsure what CIPs are - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140).  


**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Extend token metadata for translations](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/488) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This proposal defines an addition to [CIP-25 | Media NFT Metadata Standard](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0025) to support more languages than English.
* [CIP-0030 | Better describe API extension compatibility](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/486) **\[New Discussions\]**:
   * This update to [CIP-30](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030) attempts to add additional clarity and guardrails to the API extension mechanism recently introduced in [#446](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/446).

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CPS-???? | Voltaire era Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/481):
   * This CPS tried to frame a set of motivations, goals, constraints, and open questions for the very broad topic of Cardano governance.
   * This is to accompany [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380) to allow for discussion of the problem of governance rather than the technical solution.
* [CIP-0045? | Decentralized WebRTC dApp-Wallet Communication](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/395):
   * This proposal describes a decentralized communication method between dApps and wallets based on WebTorrent trackers and WebRTC.
* This has seen some decent engagement and is an interesting idea.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #63:
* **Postponed to April 4th 5:30 GMT**
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBC

Additional governance and Catalyst community conversations can be followed on [the official Cardano forum here](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). Check out the diversity in the topics and solutions discussed, and don't be shy to be part of the conversation.

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hhql7l3guira1.png?width=1230&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a9f0311145fc43bf5c06c60ea9ff62b6a259ddf

One of this year’s primary objectives has been to help educate the community on the technical functionality required to run Catalyst. Part of that mission has been to increase transparency in the backend systems. Of course, with this comes the need to continue community collaboration, and we’re hoping to see members champion community co-creation as they help to build and suggest improvements to these systems.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

In case you don’t have the time to read the article (it’s short though) but here goes.
Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano (ADA), believes that in the next 5-10 years, nation-states could use Cardano's technology to run their countries. 
This could include national identity systems, payment systems, or even central bank digital currencies. 
However, Hoskinson warns that there are powerful forces trying to stop the progress of cryptocurrencies and decentralization, and that it's important for individuals to have control over their money, identity, data, and economic agency while limiting government power.",2023-04-02 06:07:40

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Our method removes the need for API calls for fixed / known assets held in light wallets. You can also connect multiple wallets at once. You can see in this demo how fast the connector works, also shown is the really awesome avatar customiser that pulls in data from over 12 policies in seconds.

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-04-01 05:30:11
535,This morning I decided to withdraw my staking rewards after I thought the lastest rewards had been issued but it must have been during the staking epoch. Now the transaction seems to be stuck. It is showing my ADA withdrawal is submitted and is greyed out in the transaction. The dashboard shows a new reward total including the amount I tried to withdraw. This withdrawal was made in Yoroi in Brave browser. If I have a look at Yoroi in Chrome or Firefox the transaction is not shown. Will this correct it self in time or should I do a withrawal of the current total rewards in one of the other browsers?,2023-03-31 23:31:21

27. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

33. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

40. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

47. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

58. Here’s Caitlin Long on the Banking Crisis. She is absolutely the most knowledgeable person on banking in crypto. If there is anyone I would trust on banking matters, it would be her. [https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU](https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU)
59. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI)
60. Wow. Did Cointelegraph really try to claim we have no self-custody in Cardano staking? [https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616](https://twitter.com/PhilippeVleLong/status/1639663904795119616)
61. Coinbase is updating its staking services (including those related to ADA) and says it will “acts only as a service provider connecting you, the validators, and the protocol.” [https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/coinbase-earn/rewards)
62. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

63. People are divided on whether GPT4 will swallow everything and if any skill matters right now other than prompt engineering. But, it looks like Cardano smart contract development is definitely on the radar for that conversation.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-03-31 05:30:09

When the 'health factor' of a loan is below 1, anyone can call the liquidate contract to repay part of the debt owed and receive discounted collateral in return.  Liqwid incentivizes SPOs and developers to participate in the health of the overall protocol, by acting in their own interest (to receive the discounted collateral) and as a result, ensure loans are sufficiently collateralized.

557,"I have been a holder of ADA for a while now but since life has taken over a bit, I haven’t been able to keep track of any news in a little over a year, for really any of my holdings. I’m starting to do some research but curious how everyone else is seeing the chain. 

One of the projects I found was Iagon. I actually started to look into filecoin and storj but since I mainly hold ADA, I was looking for a storage project on cardano. My issue with it is that it’s catering to data centers and not home users. Are there any other decentralized storage projects upcoming? How about decentralized compute, similar to flux nodes? 

I also just saw that IOHK is releasing a new wallet. Is that something that Ada holders have to update to instead of Daedalus?  

My goal is just to keep up to date with crypto as a whole and more specifically Ada. I recently decided I was going to try my hand at creating my own stake pool, so I want to be able to keep up on everything, but I need to do my research of what has happened to really keep up to date.

Edit: just noticed that the IOHK wallet is a light browser wallet. Great for new comers and people who don’t want to wait a whole day to update Daedalus",2023-03-30 12:18:47

560,"Cardano is a Peer-to-Peer network. This means that anyone can run their own node, which is easy, cheap, and requires no third-party approval. Have you ever thought that a single entity could run multiple nodes? In theory, there's nothing to prevent it. The question is what someone could gain by doing so. If an attacker running many nodes under one identity could gain some competitive advantage over other nodes, this would be a so-called Sybil attack. Peer-to-Peer networks must be able to resist this attack. Cardano uses ADA coins to prevent Sybil attacks and maintains the security and integrity of the network.

# TLDR

Blockchain decentralization must be based on expensive resources and not on the ability to run a node or create a wallet (account). The number of nodes in the network is completely irrelevant to decentralization. There are thousands of pools and 1.3M stakers in the Cardano network. This is the decentralization of the Cardano network, but it is important to remember that an individual can have multiple staking wallets or run multiple pools. The ADA holder does not need to run a full node and can participate in the decentralization of the network through the wallet and get rewarded for it. On-chain governance should work very similarly to block production. DReps will have as much decision-making power as the stake they get from delegates. 

**Why must decentralization be based on an expensive resource?**

In general, a Sybil attack is a type of online security attack where a single entity creates multiple fake identities or accounts on a network or system to gain an unfair advantage or control over it. The goal of a Sybil attacker is to control a significant portion of the network, allowing them to influence decisions, manipulate data, or disrupt the network's functioning. In the context of blockchain, a Sybil attack can be implemented through the creation of multiple wallets or by running multiple nodes. It depends on what the attacker's goal is and what advantage he wants to gain.

43. Here’s an interesting theory: taking down Binance would create too big a hole, so they took down Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature to insulate the fiat world from crypto. Now they can take down Binance. [https://twitter.com/BryceWeiner/status/1636055979870818305](https://twitter.com/BryceWeiner/status/1636055979870818305)

54. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

60. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

74. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

89. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

572,"Hi all,

Im currently holding 2000 tokens in Binance, but i would like to move them to Revolut.
So my question is - which is the most secure, legitimate way of doing it, because i’ve never done it before.

I’m also on a big loss there, because when i bought them, they were worth 1.5$ per token. So i guess i shouldn’t pay any taxes right?


Many thanks,
Artin",2023-03-29 18:04:30
573,"After researching Lace I think the potential to facilitate mass adoption is there. 

Lace aims to be super easy to use, and the best part is that everything crypto-related that you might need can be found and used without ever leaving Lace. 

You can access a Dapp store, where you will have certified Dapps and Smart contracts for everything you need, you will have access to educational content, and even the possibility to participate in governance. 

Better than that it’s not just cardano, but Lace aims to be Multichain

If you want to know more about Lace and what to expect about it, check out this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Higj2lQxao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Higj2lQxao)",2023-03-29 17:55:20

577,"Computers changed the world because we were able to write more efficient software. Computers have automated many tasks that were previously performed by humans, especially in areas such as accounting, science, and other fields that involve large amounts of data processing. In many industries, we didn't mind, and greater efficiency was seen as an advantage. Technology is now getting into areas where we are becoming more vigilant. Even though banks are using modern software and the internet, now is the time when technology can take the next step and replace other financial services processes. Could decentralized technologies be the next step that fundamentally changes the financial sector? And what role can Cardano play in this? 

# TLDR

Banks have never failed because of a software bug. It is time to reflect on whether decentralization can improve the functioning of banks. We can certainly write software better than we can put responsible and reliable people in key positions. So far, people have mostly failed us. Software can't do that and does exactly what it's programmed to do. It's time to trust the code more than the people. We will always need people to make risk assessments or investment recommendations. So we need to look for the right connection between people and a decentralized bank. Decentralization can solve some of the problems of banks and better protect depositors' assets. Smart contracts can form a key part of banking software and all assets will be on the blockchain.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

587,"Hey all! New to this subreddit, but been a long-time Cardano fan recently getting back into the space. I have been searching for new projects, and as a climate-change activity myself wanted to give an objective take on a project I came across recently that aligns with my interests and I'm eager to hear everyone's thoughts on the project. Note that most of the information here is from their whitepaper which was released rather recently.

eTukTuk is a project that aims to revolutionize the transportation sector in developing countries and beyond by building an affordable network of charging stations and proprietary electric vehicles. The project seeks to tackle air pollution, CO2-related health conditions, and financial exclusion, which are major challenges in developing nations across the globe.

The eTukTuk ecosystem has been developed over the last five years, and it is expected to have a direct impact on reducing air pollution, CO2-related health conditions, and financial exclusion in developing countries. The project offers a sustainable and scalable solution to the 270 million internal combustion engine (ICE) TukTuks and other two- and three-wheeler vehicles that are having a detrimental impact on developing economies.

The project aims to create a culture of innovation, act with integrity, and empower the masses. eTukTuk envisions a future where anyone can be involved in tackling air pollution, CO2-related health conditions, and financial exclusion. The project has the potential to revolutionize the transportation sector in developing economies and beyond.

eTukTuk will be built on Cardano, a third-generation blockchain platform that offers advanced functionality and security features. The use of blockchain technology allows eTukTuk to address some of the pressing issues faced by developing countries, such as financial exclusion, transparency, and accountability.

The project will use smart contracts to ensure the efficient and secure operation of the network. It will also leverage the Cardano blockchain's banking capabilities to bank the unbanked and reduce the cost of financial transactions. Additionally, eTukTuk will use a side-chain to separate the network's operational functionalities from the Cardano ecosystem's main blockchain, providing more flexibility and scalability.

The eTukTuk project also features a unique token economics model that is designed to incentivize network participants to act in the best interest of the ecosystem. The token will be used to reward participants for contributing to the network's growth and overall sustainability.

Overall, eTukTuk represents an exciting opportunity to address some of the significant challenges faced by developing countries. The project's focus on sustainability, scalability, and inclusivity, coupled with its use of advanced blockchain technology, makes it a compelling project to watch in the Cardano ecosystem.

Would love to hear anyone's thoughts. My biggest concerns relate the the price barriers for carrying out such an initiative, but other than that it's great to see more sustainability projects coming into the space.",2023-03-28 21:57:50

591,"Every decentralized and public blockchain network needs some means on which decentralization is based. For Cardano, it's ADA coins. This is a finite, non-renewable resource with a non-zero market value. For PoW networks like Bitcoin, the two resources are ASIC hardware and electricity. Both resources are renewable, infinite (can be produced over and over), and have a non-zero market value. Let's take a closer look at Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work and compare the advantages and disadvantages in the context of different attack vectors.

# TLDR

The 51% attack is very costly for Cardano and Bitcoin and probably difficult to commit in practice. However, it is not the only attack vector against which the blockchain must be resilient. Protection against many attacks is based on decentralization. PoW miners fight among themselves and drive each other out of business. This leads to more centralization and therefore weakened security, especially against internal attacks (censorship resistance). ADA holders are working together to decentralize and secure Cardano not only when it comes to the production of blocks but in near future also within governance. Dysfunctional governance can also be one of the attack vectors.

13. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.

14. Rep. Emmer (Pro-Crypto) called the current regulatory approach “lazy & destructive…that is chilling innovation.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670)
15. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto? [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5266](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5266)
16. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure). [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703)
17. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

19. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

21. The Feds were taking bids for anyone to acquire SVB until 2pm Eastern on Sunday. The big question on Sunday was whether the Feds will cover all uninsured depositors.

23. Yellen said NO to a bailout for SVB on Sunday. She’s obviously got bigger macro concerns. But, it’s funny how that fits perfectly with a strategy of suppressing stablecoins generally.

43. Here’s an interesting theory: taking down Binance would create too big a hole, so they took down Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature to insulate the fiat world from crypto. Now they can take down Binance. [https://twitter.com/BryceWeiner/status/1636055979870818305](https://twitter.com/BryceWeiner/status/1636055979870818305)

54. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more). [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636827051419389952](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1636827051419389952)

60. Here’s why they are opening the swap lines: so that US treasuries don’t get dumped on the open market by foreign banks. This way the foreign central banks can have dollars to absorb the treasuries from the foreign banks.

67. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

74. Coinbase just revealed receipt of a Wells Notice. This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action. Basically, the SEC has launched its full war against crypto. [https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184](https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1638660032324829184)

89. This is being interpreted by some as a move toward on-chain only staking that may positively impact the decentralization of validation in blockchains like Cardano. But, we’ll see what validators they aim their delegation at.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

595,"I've seen all this talk about ""if you stake ADA, and then add more ADA to that wallet, the added amount becomes automatically staked"".

However, what's not clear to me is, **which address** should I send the additional ADA to? Does it matter? Since Cardano is UTXO, I'm getting a different ADA address every time. Does it matter if it's an old address or a new address? Can I send to a brand new address on the same wallet and still have it added to my stake?

Also, how soon are the rewards paid out **on the portion that is newly staked**? For example, if I have 100 ADA staked now and choose to add another 500 ADA later, will the 500 amount be subject to waiting three epochs before rewards are earned from it?",2023-03-27 04:10:31

598,"Some things coming to Cardano in the rest of 2023:

* [USDA](https://www.anzens.com/) fiat-backed stable coin by Emurgo. This nicely complements Djed and iUSD.
* [Ouroboros Genesis](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/02/09/ouroboros-genesis-enhanced-security-in-a-dynamic-environment/), making Cardano the only PoS network which can bootstrap from Genesis without trusted checkpoints.
* Improved developer experience thanks to [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org/) smart contract platform. Interesting alternatives include Eopsin, Helios, Plutarch, Plu-ts, Scalus. Developers can step away from Plutus Tx. Smart contract development gets easier and smart contracts become much smaller.
* [Mithril](https://docs.cardano.org/development-guidelines/scalability-solutions/mithril), allowing quick syncing of the blockchain so that light wallets can sync in a trustless way.
* [Hydra](https://hydra.family/head-protocol/), a L2 solution using isomorphic state channels. Caveat: This is NOT an easy fix that can simply scale all Cardano dapps, it remains to be seen what parts of Cardano can actually be scaled by Hydra. This currently is a bit complicated. Sundaeswap is experimenting with Hydra, but Axo devs do not think Hydra is good for scaling DEXs...
* [Lace wallet](https://www.lace.io/), an open source wallet by IOG.
* Launch of the EVM side chain by IOG. I'm not really excited about the EVM side chain itself, but the side chain toolkit in general is interesting and I think this side chain can act as an example for other side chains.
* Launch of many interesting dapps like [Axo Trade](https://www.axo.trade/) (first DEX to really leverage eUTXO model), [Meld](https://www.meld.com/), [Genius Yield](https://www.geniusyield.co/), [Spectrum Finance](https://spectrum.fi/) (first open source truly decentralized DEX), [Aneta BTC](https://anetabtc.io/) (trustless wrapped BTC), [TeddySwap](https://teddyswap.org/). Also further developments on [Liqwid](https://www.liqwid.finance/) pooled lending and launch of [Aada Finance V2](https://aada.finance/) with pooled lending.
* Launch of digital identies (DIDs) [Atala Prism](https://atalaprism.io/) and [IAMX](https://iamx.id/). 
* Integration of oracle solutions [Charli3](https://charli3.io/?__cf_chl_tk=L2Ej.4xr8wyhALGkQhx81de13QlbepNCFZyPFuQ27WI-1679917352-0-gaNycGzNCyU) and [Orcfax](https://orcfax.io/). 

Edit: Some developments that I expect in 2024:  


* [Ouroboros Leios](https://twitter.com/_KtorZ_/status/1596108547942670338) (a.k.a. Input Endorsers). This feature will greatly improve the throughput of Cardano's L1. 
* [Midnight](https://midnight.iohk.io/) side chain. A privacy side chain by IOG which allows users to control their data, with private smart contracts written in Typescript. ",2023-03-27 08:58:17
599,"I’m trying to understand some of basic functionality differences between Atala Prism and Solid. 

I get Prism is “built of the block chain” but how specifically? Is the data stored in Atala servers or somehow directly in the block chain? Or is Prism just using security certificates/ identifiers that are stored as transactions in the block chain and verifiable. Then the associated data of each account is on their servers? Which is still hackable… 

If the raw data is stored on Atala servers then why not use Prism instead? Prism allows you to self host if I’m not mistaken? (Obviously still hackable)

Is it that are they two different functions but similar uses for data?

Example: Atala allows for trust less verification say for “X”, an engineering degree. It shows proof that it was attained, issued from a university and you as end user has full control who sees/know this?

While solid allows end users to hold and control their personal data and certificates locally? Yet without any sort of confirmation and validity? 

Any help here would be greatly appreciated. 

I still feel like I’m missing something here…(or maybe a lot)

600,"Total Value Locked (TVL) makes a new ATH regularly. That's definitely a good thing for DeFi, but it's not the only important indicator we should be concerned about. More important is the activity on the network and the number of users. Cardano is growing in these stats as well. In this article, we will focus on the number of non-zero balance accounts.

# TLDR

The Shelley and Alonzo hard forks were significant milestones for Cardano. Account growth increased 12-fold in 2 years based on these events. The number of new accounts continues to grow in the current bear market. Cardano is slowly getting into a similar situation as Ethereum in 2017 when the number of accounts grew 4-fold. Cardano has a chance to reach the 10M account mark with non-zero balances in 2025. If that happens, Cardano will be almost unstoppable.

# From hundreds of thousands of users to millions in 2 years

The path to a high network effect always starts with a small number of users. Blockchain protocols are much like social networks. Their use is completely voluntary and is mainly determined by user preferences and the network effect already obtained. All newer projects have the slight disadvantage of catching up with existing ones. The blockchain industry is still very young and major waves of adoption are still ahead. It is still realistic to catch up with existing rivals in user numbers. All current dominant blockchain projects started with literal units of users. Within a few years, they have reached millions of users. This is true for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and, as you will soon see, at the moment also for Cardano. 

There was a Shelley hard fork in July 2020 which opened staking for ADA holders. Alonzo hard fork brought smart contracts to Cardano in September 2021. These were two key events in terms of adoption that kick-started the growth in accounts.

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


This past week, some of the world has changed their clocks to summer timezone. This is a kind reminder that town halls continue airing at 5PM UTC. This means that in some parts you may need to manually adjust your calendar. Another set of time changes is expected to take place this weekend already. Keep an eye on this not to miss the latest broadcast.  


Despite the time change bonanza, last week we had a great presentation and brief discussion around legal frameworks when it comes to blockchain. DLT360 team presented their impressive close out series on their funded proposal. You can check out [their timestamped segment here](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=564). Great insights. We also had three other community project presentations in form of [Neural IDs/NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=1326), [Meta DID experiment](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=2052), and [Haskell Course for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/live/TtTepcCxAzw?feature=share&t=2407). Congratulations on completing your projects.  


If you have a project that you are about to close out and wish to share with the community, reach out to me and let's schedule your presentation for one of the upcoming town halls. Let's tell the world the amazing things you're up to!  


This week, [WADA presents their impressions](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=614) from winning the film festival, [Community Advisor challenge team shares their insights](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=1658), and [the Catalyst team presents the first insight](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=2510) into proposed direction for Fund10 adjustments. Starting with assessments stage. Make sure to catch the details further down.   


For now - what's the latest? Dive in.

Governance conversations continue. Have you had a chance to participate yet? There are some opportunities for you.  


Great ways to dive into conversation is reading up [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal or catch the latest with the community initiative Voltaire News! yet? Check out [this timestamped segment](https://www.youtube.com/live/FpZf99M1i4M?feature=share&t=3078) from the last town hall to learn more. But in a nutshell: [a new collaborative community newsletter](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news) started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.  


Additionally, following on from the earlier [CIP-1694 workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWm0S_H_Qyw) in Colorado, the organizing team would like to invite all community members to a conversation on the [30th March via Zoom](https://www.addevent.com/event/TZ16421227). It will be an opportunity to recap the [workshop](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cip-1694-...) with attendees, hear more about CIP-1694, as well as discuss future workshops and the next steps along the path to the Age of Voltaire.  


If you wish to add your perspectives to CIP 1694, make sure to share them [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). Add your voice as the era of Voltaire rolls out!

# Project Catalyst is looking ahead

https://preview.redd.it/72ws3jg6fqpa1.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ed9903d4240efd32cbede8899ef5a5badf06c707

There are number of proposed changes for Fund10 that are going to be gradually shared over the weeks to come. This week, we began with looking at what an alternative path looks like for the assessments stage in Cardano's Project Catalyst.   


Catalyst funding rounds have been on pause for a little while now. Thank you everyone for your patience and continued support as we've navigated these past months. 2023 is shaping up to be an important year for Cardano, and equally so for Catalyst.

Since F9’s end, the Catalyst team’s been deep in research, discovery and design mode. Holding many workshops with the community, a lot of 1:1s, and received additional user-centered feedback from fund surveys, social media & more. All that stock has been carefully considered and time's come to share the findings and a suggested proposal for the next steps. Starting with the assessment stage.

You can catch [the main town hall segment timestamped here](https://www.youtube.com/live/lkTZkf7tKxI?feature=share&t=2510) or you can also [breeze through this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/danny_cryptofay/status/1638900080898891777). Your input would be very valuable. The after town hall recording will also be made available shortly on [Catalyst Swarm Youtube list.](https://bit.ly/33i38SB)

# Bounties? Yes, please. 

https://preview.redd.it/a3jx6lm7fqpa1.png?width=1762&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=03ba3525f19c0fe202558f342c8c0c42e2363f00

Did you know that Catalyst Swarm is pioneering and experimenting with bounties in the ecosystem? There are a variety of different bounties found on the swarm Dework bounty board \[regularly updated - new tasks continuously added\], in which you can partake in and earn some rewards (ADA, Gimbal tokens or AGIX). Check out [the bounty board via this link.](https://app.dework.xyz/catalyst-swarm/catalyst-swarm-bount)

# Funded Project Workshops 

https://preview.redd.it/vn9nqex8fqpa1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=446686953a9914abf7cddaf3b457637f9cb67d19

Catalyst has recently reached 450+ completed projects, an amazing milestone but the next question is ‘wen 500?’  


To continue to support funded projects, the Catalyst team is committed to facilitating business growth and technical workshops. The aim is to create as much education and resources as possible to support the growth, development, and success of projects building in the Catalyst ecosystem.  


We want to increase the cadence of these sessions and keep the community connected with the process. So we are opening up speaker/guest slots for business and technical leaders within the community to sign up and deliver presentations at the workshop sessions, taking place on the bi-weekly coordinator meetings.  


To help facilitate, you can sign up via this form: [https://bit.ly/42ffVyL](https://bit.ly/42ffVyL)

# New Funded Project Guidelines 

https://preview.redd.it/uoca8xcafqpa1.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0258ebf4182631d225b5ab70b8ef59e98e4712d5

The Catalyst team has been collecting feedback from funded projects via various workshops and retrospectives on iterations for post funded process flow. As the complexity and volume of requests grows each fund, several processes have been introduced as a proposal to help address some of the growing challenges.  


We would love your feedback [by leaving a comment on this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JG1lJhUUZshocMJsLxJbslxiLR2B_af9hBSA68w3xJ4/edit). The goal is to consider any additional comments and feedback before rolling out the new guidelines to be in effect from April 1st.  


Thank you in advance for your kind time and efforts.

# Last week in CIPs

https://preview.redd.it/7sd4i1rbfqpa1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=907cbbe566dfcc68b92dc7279b03a17124aa4885

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If are unsure what CIPs are about - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Supercharged Native Scripts](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/479) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This CIP proposes replacing the current native scripts used for minting Cardano Native Tokens with simple smart contracts.
* [CPS-???? | Voltaire era Governance](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/481) **\[New Problem\]**:
   * This CPS tried to frame a set of motivations, goals, constraints, and open questions for the very broad topic of Cardano governance.
   * This is to accompany CIP-1694 to allow for discussion of the problem of governance rather than the technical solution.

**RW:** CIP Editors Meeting #62 -- my notes:

* [CIP-0084? | Ledger evolution (meta)](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/456):
   * Looking good to merge -- due to the nature of the proposal it does not need much engagement past the Ledger team.
   * With post meeting clarification on RSS CIPs application to the Ledger category, this is in Last Check for the next meeting.
* [CIP-0030 | Upgrade to latest format & propose version / extension scheme](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/446):
   * With small amendments to remove positional arguments, this can be merged as it has a lot of positive discussion.
* [CIP-0090? | Extendable dApp-Wallet Web Bridge](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/462):
   * Author (me) present to discuss.
   * Overall needs more discussion from wallet providers.
   * Number can be assigned.
* [CIP-0091? | Don't force Built-In functions](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/459):
   * Lots of good discussion with author engaging very well.
   * Assign a number and look to merge in the next meeting.
* [CIP-0092? | First-class errors in Plutus](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/469):
   * Author present and provided great explanation.
   * Benchmarks/analysis on how much more efficient this is would be nice.
* [CIP-0089? | Beacon Tokens & Distributed Dapps](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/466):
   * Seems to be some off-github discussions around this proposal - would be good to link them.
   * Can assign a number.
   * Somewhat informal, might benefit from a CPS.
* [CIP-0088?: Native Asset Policy Registration/Information Certificates](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/467):
   * Can assign a number.
   * Author has had some good engagement.
   * More comments and discussion around related CIPs and CPSs should be added.
* [CPS-???? | Reading metadata in Plutus contracts](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/474):
   * More detail is needed.
   * This is more of a feature request than a problem statement. Furthermore this is a feature which had purposely not included by the Plutus team.
   * So this is rejected for now.
* [CIP-0030 | Add chain id to differentiate between testnets](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/323):
   * Has good support.
   * This should fit as an extension to CIP-30 as discussed in [#466](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/446), although it is unclear if the author wants to pursue.
* [CIP-0077? | Verified Stake Pool Identity](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/361):
   * Could benefit from more discussion by SPOs.
   * Good and timely proposal.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #63:
   * March 28th 5pm UTC.
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBC

Further varied governance and Catalyst community conversations can be also followed on [the official Cardano forum here](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). Don't be shy to be part of the conversation.

# Gimbalabs presents: Plutus Project-Based Learning

https://preview.redd.it/uk3kxgqmfqpa1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc910c96027e9f686ee81938a935d3b51cfc75d0

This week, [Gimbalabs](https://twitter.com/gimbalabs) launched the new version of their Plutus Project-Based Learning program. The two previous versions led them to this fantastic version: [https://plutuspbl.io  ](https://plutuspbl.io/)

No doubt, PPBL v3 is the answer to the question: Where do I start as a Cardano developer, now? 

👩‍🏭now = no money, no pre-requirements, no gatekeepers.👨‍🏭

Note 1: Great news: Gimbalabs Plutus PBL is in the process of being translated into several languages, including: Indonesian, French, Vietnamese, Japanese, Spanish. Soon it will be in your own language.

This program is open source, which makes it adaptable to the needs of different organizations. If you🫵 want to train your employees, your students, your community, your team members, your family and friends: the time is now 🫵 (the now from above, remember?). Need help: leave them a message on twitter:  [@gimbalabs](https://twitter.com/gimbalabs)

Did you ever wonder how Cardano Treasury functions? And its origins? Markus has written a fantastic tweet thread that dives into this topic. Markus has been a long time community member and stake pool operator since the early days of Cardano. Definitely worth a read.

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

One of this year’s primary objectives is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

Let’s go….

Newly Covered Today:

1. IOG dropped a recap of the CIP-1694 workshop. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1639030606100332545](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1639030606100332545)

5. Here’s Caitlin Long on the Banking Crisis. She is absolutely the most knowledgeable person on banking in crypto. If there is anyone I would trust on banking matters, it would be her. [https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU](https://youtu.be/QM5h1oybxPU)
6. Here’s the wilder, more extreme take from Balaji. Interestingly, he and Caitlin disagree about how many big prints are left and they both say the position of the other could be right. [https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN\_lCI](https://youtu.be/G9ULrFN_lCI) 

Previously covered, but still interesting:

2. Emin Gün Sirer is right about these centralized L2s. Very susceptible to regulations and cut against our crypto ethos of decentralization generally. [https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1631423491470704640](https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1631423491470704640)

15. Wow! Utah just passed a bill instituting Limited Liability Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (LLDs). You have to identify one human organizer. You can elect to be taxed as a corp or LLC (pass through taxation). Some will like it. Some won’t. But, the mainstream reach of crypto is undeniably growing.

16. Sen. Lummis killed it in a recent hearing defending the energy use in crypto. It’s less relevant for us in Cardano since we’re not PoW. But, still entertaining to watch.

31. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way.

34. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

35. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.

37. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

38. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

39. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

43. The Feds were taking bids for anyone to acquire SVB until 2pm Eastern on Sunday. The big question on Sunday was whether the Feds will cover all uninsured depositors.

76. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto. Balaji is burning a few million to ring the fire alarm and make everyone aware of what he believes is an impending attack on dollar holders. Counterparty is guaranteed $1million (minus BTC price) if he just buys one additional BTC (or an option to purchase more).

This means the SEC has concluded their investigation and they are (theoretically) inviting Coinbase to convince them otherwise before they file an enforcement action.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

628,"## Cardano Roadmap: A Unique Approach to Blockchain Development

**Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform that was created with the goal of solving some of the key challenges facing the industry today.** To achieve this, the **Cardano team developed a roadmap consisting of five phases** that would guide the evolution of the platform over time. Each of the five eras in the Cardano roadmap is named after a person who made significant contributions to their respective fields. Such as literature, poetry or mathematics.

**One of the unique aspects of Cardano's development is its commitment to scientific rigor.** The **Cardano team is led by Charles Hoskinson**, a co-founder of Ethereum and a mathematician by training. **Hoskinson has assembled a team of academics and researchers to work on the platform**, and the team regularly publishes peer-reviewed research on topics such as consensus mechanisms and smart contract programming languages. **This scientific approach to development sets Cardano apart from other blockchain platforms** and has helped to establish it as a leader in the industry.

https://preview.redd.it/ehf7k20fvjpa1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3e20cacade64e609b948b988c433bb6e480435af

##### These five phases are:

1. **Byron:** The first phase of the **Cardano roadmap focused on establishing the core infrastructure of the platform.** During this phase, the team worked to create a solid foundation for the platform, including the development of a robust consensus mechanism called Ouroboros.
2. **Shelley:** The second phase of the roadmap, **Shelley, was focused on decentralization.** This phase **introduced staking and delegation, allowing Cardano holders to participate in the consensus process and earn rewards** for helping to secure the network. Shelley also saw the launch of the Cardano mainnet, marking a major milestone in the platform's development.
3. **Goguen:** The third phase of the Cardano roadmap is Goguen, which is **focused on smart contract functionality. This phase will introduce the Plutus programming language**, which is designed to make it easier for developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the Cardano platform. Additionally, Goguen will introduce Marlowe, a domain-specific language that will enable the creation of financial contracts.
4. **Basho:** The fourth phase of the Cardano roadmap is **Basho, which is focused on scalability. This phase will introduce sharding and sidechains, which will allow the Cardano network to process a greater number of transactions per second.** Basho will also see the introduction of new consensus algorithms, including Proof of Stake Sidechains (POSS).
5. **Voltaire:** The final phase of the Cardano roadmap is **Voltaire, which is focused on governance and sustainability. This phase will introduce a treasury system that will fund the ongoing development and maintenance of the platform.** Additionally, Voltaire will introduce a voting system that will enable Cardano stakeholders to participate in the decision-making process for the platform.

Check out Cardano whiteboard overview with Charles Hoskinson explaining the roadmap phases on YouTube. 

**What sets Cardano apart from other blockchain platforms is its unique approach to development. The platform is built on three core principles: scalability, sustainability, and interoperability.** Cardano's focus on scalability is evident in its implementation of sharding and sidechains in the Basho phase, as well as its efficient consensus mechanism, Ouroboros. **The platform's focus on sustainability is achieved through its treasury system, which funds ongoing development and maintenance.** Finally, **Cardano's focus on interoperability is achieved through the use of multiple programming languages and a modular architecture that allows for customization.**

In conclusion, the **Cardano roadmap is a clear and deliberate plan for the evolution of the platform over time.** By focusing on scalability, sustainability, and interoperability, the Cardano team has created a platform that is well-suited for a wide range of use cases and has the potential to drive significant innovation in the years to come. As the platform continues to evolve through its five phases, we can expect to see even more exciting developments from the Cardano team. **As of March 2023, Cardano is currently progressing in the Voltaire phase of its roadmap with several latest updates.**",2023-03-23 20:40:44

642,"Most stakers understand the basic principles of Proof-of-Stake and know that every epoch (5 days) they will receive rewards from the protocol if the pool to which the ADA coins are delegated has minted at least one block. There is confusion about how rewards are distributed by the Cardano protocol. In this article, we will explain this.

**TLDR**

* Rewards for staking are accumulated in a reward account that uses a balance rather than a UTXO-style accounting model.
* The reward balance increases every epoch and ADAs are automatically delegated to the pool. 
* Reward balance does not count as voting power in Catalyst. In order for ADA to be counted, a withdrawal is required through an on-chain transaction. 
* The current system does not require regular actions from stakers and saves resources.

35. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected.

38. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

656,"The traditional financial world is in trouble as banks in the US and Europe have begun to fail. Governments and central banks are implementing measures that will have an impact on rising inflation. This is not the first time we have seen a similar scenario. Similar events have been repeated over and over again. Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 crisis. A decade later, we have other blockchain projects like Cardano, which can replace the banking system in another 5 to 10 years. They say that cryptocurrencies are to blame for the current financial problems. How is that possible? It must be said emphatically that the current problems have other reasons. They are the fractional reserve system, endless money printing, bailing out failing banks, poor risk management, corruption, and other things. The blockchain industry is the solution to many of the current problems of banks.

**TLDR**

* Bankers benefit from the fractional reserve system, but depositors bear the risks.
* Bearing the risk should mean accepting the loss if expectations are not met. If we do not keep this rule, it will lead to a loss of trust in the system.
* The ""fix the money, fix the world"" narrative is partly false. Fixing the financial system requires changing the rules.
* Cardano will allow us to create money with stable purchasing power backed by digital assets.
* Cardano will allow us to create a bank whose services will always be 100% backed by its own capital. The bank would be transparent and profits would be shared fairly with depositors.

4. You gotta admit. Balaji is genius at inventing new tag lines. First it was “We are all bitcoin maximalists now.” Today it’s “Fed around and find out.” [https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1638349643854786560)

15. Wow! Utah just passed a bill instituting Limited Liability Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (LLDs). You have to identify one human organizer. You can elect to be taxed as a corp or LLC (pass through taxation). Some will like it. Some won’t. But, the mainstream reach of crypto is undeniably growing.

31. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python.

34. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners.

35. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected.

37. Rep. Foster (Cryptophobe): “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto?

38. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

39. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

41. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs.

43. The Feds were taking bids for anyone to acquire SVB until 2pm Eastern on Sunday. The big question on Sunday was whether the Feds will cover all uninsured depositors.

76. This is one of the craziest things I’ve seen in crypto.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

665,"Cardano uses ADA coins to reward pool operators and stakers, but also to fund Catalyst projects. In the future, coins from the project treasury will be used to reward DReps and the team that maintains the source code and implements protocol changes. Where does Cardano get these coins? Let's study the project's monetary policy and reward mechanism. 

# TLDR

* Unlike Bitcoin, Cardano has a project treasury so that development and governance can remain independent of VC funding.
* From the total epoch reward, 20% of the ADA coins will be moved to the project treasury and the rest will be used for staking rewards.
* Part of the incentive mechanism is to promote decentralization. If the protocol requirements for pools are not met, a portion of the staking reward is returned to the reserve.
* Cardano may find itself in a situation where the block production group is fighting for resources with the governance group.
* ADA coins are being used up from the reserve at a slower rate than originally anticipated.
* Decentralization is dependent on the project treasury.

# Monetary policy of the Cardano protocol

Cardano is being built to be independent of external funding in the future, especially from VC funds. The IOG team has been working on the development of the protocol and will hand it over to the community in the Voltaire era. Cardano needs to have enough ADA coins not only for block production rewards but also for the on-chain government. Delegation Representatives (DReps) will also receive rewards. In addition to the reserve, which every blockchain has in some form and contains coins for future rewards for those who participate in the production of blocks, Cardano has a project treasury. ADA coins from the project treasury will be used to fund governance (Voltaire), protocol development, and ecosystem development (Catalyst).

667,"Hello Community, I am one of the Co-Founders of Xerberus, and I wanted to introduce our project and our live app and invite you to try the software out. 

**TLDR:** We are like Nansen.ai, grown out of the Cardano Ecosystem and building the best wallet labeling engine to make Crypto safer for all of us <3 

**Why are we building Xerberus?**

Crypto has a transparency issue. Most of us have invested money into a project only to realize shortly afterward that most of the claims made by the project were not true. Often, these situations combine average business risk, moral hazard, and malicious behavior. Cardano is no exception; we all have one or the other project name we think of when reading this paragraph. 

**Where is the software right now?** 

Xerberus helps you to understand more about projects with a few clicks. For example, you can use Xerberus to check if the wallets holding the token resemble advertised tokenomics (Spoiler: Most of the time, they don't). You also explore all major wallets holding a token and see if they are individuals, DEXs, or project-related wallets such as treasury or distribution. 

**What will come next?** 

The platform we are building is still in its infancy, but the basics are standing. We plan many more features to come soon; the most central element is our wallet labeling engine. This engine will automatically label all wallets within an ecosystem, making it ridiculously easy to spot subscription behavior like wash-trading or team members breaking their vesting schedule.

They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

41. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

681,"Many people think that the decentralization of blockchains is based only on block production. Underneath the Proof-of-Stake (or another consensus) layer is the peer-to-peer network (or gossip network) that is used to connect the nodes. This is a physical infrastructure that you can think of as nodes connected by a network cable. Above these layers, there is the governance layer that is used for project management. Decentralization could not be achieved without the existence of a distributed network. Security depends on both of these layers. It is important to consider security and decentralization comprehensively and include all three layers. An attack on the blockchain can target any layer. If the network layer is successfully attacked, the consensus layer may also be compromised. With the new Cardano node version 1.35.6, network participants can start using automated dynamically updated P2P configuration without a need for manual maintenance. The Cardano network layer is becoming more secure and performant.

# TLDR

* With the older version of the Cardano node, SPOs had to manually maintain an unnecessarily large number of connections to peers. 
* Dynamic P2P enables an automated process that through self-discovery and optimization finds the most suitable peers.
* The network is more resistant to DoS attacks. 
* The Cardano node will automatically reconfigure connections to peer nodes to make the speed of data distribution in the P2P network near optimal.

67. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

My opinion is that such news evaluators should summarise information in an easy-to-read format, and that they be apart of the MBOs as they would be obliged to reinforce the Cardano Constitution.

That way the voters and dReps could more be more easily informed that leads to more efficient decisions to be made. This hopefully leads to an increase in community engagement and more effective means of governance for the Cardano ecosystem.

713,"Cardano projects show great potential with public teams, clear roadmaps, and promising KPIs. However, despite their excellence, attracting new users to the community remains a challenge. Many projects assume that they can provide the best solutions for users without considering that newcomers may find it difficult to understand the new mechanisms. This is where Whiteboard Cardano comes in as a solution that prioritizes video marketing and simplifying complex technical terms into understandable examples. By focusing on content and image quality, Whiteboard Cardano aims to create a welcoming and approachable environment for new members to learn about blockchain technology and Cardano. Marketing is a critical aspect that cannot be overlooked, as even the best projects may struggle without enough users. Therefore, Whiteboard Cardano's emphasis on marketing will be essential in bringing new users to the Cardano community and promoting the growth of the ecosystem.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

I am not boosting so I should be getting 3.009 % + 1.639 % + 2.815 % = 7.463% APR

I can see some WRT rewards coming in, but they add up to nowhere near 7.4%, in fact are less than half that. Should I see all of these rewards there or is that actually only the Farm APR I see there?

If so, where can I see the total rewards I am actually getting? Thanks",2023-03-16 15:19:49

726,"Total Value Locked (TVL) has been rising steeply since the start of February 2023 and is making new ATH in a bear market when that is not usual. Cardano reached its previous ATH in March 2022 when TVL was at 324M ADA. We are now at 362M ADA (118M USD). DeFi on Cardano is unique in this respect. For all other major smart contract platforms, the number of native coins locked in DeFi is deeply below ATH. TVL in dollar value is low in the case of Cardano compared to some platforms where it is locked up to over a billion dollars and even tens of billions of dollars for Ethereum. If the trend holds, Cardano has a chance to catch up to the current champions within a year or two.

727,"Today marks the much-awaited launch of the Rosen Bridge testnet, a significant step towards facilitating cross-chain communication between Cardano and Ergo. This collaboration between the two blockchain projects has the potential to yield significant benefits for both ecosystems. Here are a few reasons why Cardano and Ergo are a perfect match:

Security and Consensus Diversity: Cardano's Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and Ergo's Proof of Work (PoW) offer unique security benefits. The collaboration can lead to exploring new ways to enhance security and optimize consensus mechanisms.

Interoperability: The Rosen Bridge will enable seamless cross-chain transactions between Cardano and Ergo, creating a more unified blockchain ecosystem. This enhanced interoperability can drive adoption and encourage developers to create cross-chain applications.

Complementary Features: Both platforms offer features that can benefit each other. Cardano's smart contract infrastructure, Plutus, and Ergo's privacy-enhancing Sigma protocols can inspire innovations and lead to more comprehensive solutions.

UTXO and eUTXO Models: Cardano and Ergo both utilize the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, with Ergo adopting an extended version (eUTXO). This shared foundation enables better compatibility, allowing for more efficient cross-chain interactions and the development of innovative solutions that leverage the strengths of both models.

Expanding the Ecosystem: The partnership between Cardano and Ergo has the potential to attract more developers, users, and investors to both projects. This expanded ecosystem can foster the development of new decentralized applications (dApps) and use cases.

With the launch of the Rosen Bridge testnet, the collaboration between Cardano and Ergo is poised to bring significant value to both communities. Their combined strengths in security, interoperability, complementary features, UTXO/eUTXO models, and an expanded ecosystem set the stage for a bright future in the blockchain space.",2023-03-16 01:41:05

43. Wow! Utah just passed a bill instituting Limited Liability Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (LLDs). You have to identify one human organizer. You can elect to be taxed as a corp or LLC (pass through taxation). Some will like it. Some won’t. But, the mainstream reach of crypto is undeniably growing.

59. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way.

62. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget\_fy2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf) 
63. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4\_KwNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4_KwNU)

66. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).

67. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.”  [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

69. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

A note from EMURGO: Many scammers will use fake websites to get you to login to your wallets and steal your crypto. To help prevent this, **we are now using Typeform instead of Google Forms**, which is a common attack point for scammers. Be vigilant. We will NEVER ask you for your seed phrase.

In recent debates, it has become apparent that people don't fully understand how staking and block production are related. Some people mistakenly believe that if a pool started using Contingent Staking (CS) functionality and required KYC from stakers, it would simultaneously start censoring transactions. In this context, the two functionalities are completely separate. SPOs can already filter transactions today and do not need CS. Conversely, a pool that would require KYC from stakers can insert a transaction into the block regardless of the fact that the blockchain address is blacklisted. Let's describe it in more detail.

# TLDR

* SPOs can censor transactions by modifying the source code of the Cardano node. 
* Even if 80% of the pools censor transactions according to the same blacklist, the blacklisted transactions still get into the blockchain through the other 20% of the pools.
* If regulators want to force SPOs to censor transactions, they can do it today.
* If SPOs want to successfully operate a pool, their conduct must be consistent with the wishes of ADA holders. The degree of censorship of transactions on Cardano is primarily determined by ADA holders.
* Censorship is prevented by decentralization, permissionless ness, and openness of Cardano. 
* A staker can delegate ADA to a pool and still the pool can censor transactions of the delegator. 
* If the ADA holders refuse KYC and transaction censorship then no central authority has a chance to curb their will.

Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

747,"The US government is proposing to impose a 30% tax on crypto mining. The government's decision can essentially drive Proof-of-Work miners out of the country in a relatively non-violent manner. If mining is unprofitable, there is no point in continuing. The U.S. and China are the two most economically powerful countries in the world that are pushing mining out of their territory. The problem with mining is that it is easy to detect and cannot be operated unless conditions are favorable. This contrasts with Proof-of-Stake networks like Cardano. If you hold ADA coins, the government can't restrict you from participating in the decentralization of Cardano and getting the rewards. According to the analytics firm Morning Consult, 4% of Americans held ADAs in 2022. Any of them can participate in staking and very likely do. While Bitcoin's decentralization will decrease as mining is curtailed, Cardano's decentralization is gradually increasing every year. Dependence on a physical resource is an annoying and so far seemingly effective attack vector.

# TLDR

* Crypto miners would have reporting requirements on the amount and type of electricity used. It kills anonymous mining. 
* PoW mining will likely shift from the US to Kazakhstan and Russia, where fossil fuels are used to produce electricity.
* Staking itself is essentially a very hidden and anonymous activity that is almost impossible to curb and hard to prove.
* Just keeping SEED in your head can make you an active staker.
* In PoS networks, greed has a positive effect on decentralization.
* Staking is equally available and profitable everywhere in the world.
* A virtual resource is much more difficult to fight than a physical one.

# Bitcoin mining tax 

China dominated Bitcoin mining for many years. In 2020, its share of mining was over 80%. The Chinese government decided to drive the miners out of the country, and for a short time, it succeeded. By 2021, the mining share had dropped to almost zero. Now mining is slowly returning to China. Bitcoin mining today is dominated by the US with 35%, Kazakhstan with 18%, Russia with 11% and Canada with 10%.  It seems that regulation will again significantly change the share of mining, especially in the US. US crypto miners could eventually be subject to a 30% tax on electricity costs under a budget proposal by the President aimed at reducing mining activity. The tax will apply to all types of energy, regardless of whether it is from the grid or produced by miners. The tax is expected to start at the end of 2023, phased in over three years at a rate of 10% a year, reaching the max 30% tax rate by the third year.

750,"TLDR: Smart contracts that use PlutusV1 and/or PlutusTx are inefficient. There are alternatives developed/being developed, and for Cardano to operate at its full capacity, there needs to be (more) dApps written without using PlutusV1 and PlutusTx.

Kind of a long post, so bear with me. For those who are unaware, let me explain what PlutusV1 and PlutusTx are:

PlutusV1 is the original version of Cardano's smart contract platform (Plutus). The problem with it is that it is does not have reference inputs/scripts, which means that transactions that use a PlutusV1 smart contract have to include the entire smart contract into the transaction, which would cause more bloat in tx size; this is important because block sizes are limited to 88kb in Cardano, meaning the more bloat txs are, the less txs can fit into a block.

PlutusTx is the original way to write and compile smart contracts into Plutus Core (the actual programming language in which all Cardano smart contracts are compiled to and executed in). The problem with PlutusTx is very simple: it is very inefficient. To clarify, when I say inefficient, I am referring to 3 metrics: CPU usage, Mem usage, and script size. Smart contracts written using PlutusTx are very high in all 3.

So, what are the solutions? Well, I'm sure you all know that Vasil introduced PlutusV2, which added reference inputs/scripts, thus smart contracts using PlutusV2 don't have to be included entirely in a tx that uses them. Since smart contracts can't be updated, however, dApp devs have to rewrite smart contracts in PlutusV2 if they were previously deployed in V1 (some like JPEG store and MuesliSwap have done this).

Now, what about PlutusTx? Well, there are about half a dozen alternatives to PlutusTx (the ones I know are Plutarch, Pluto, Aiken, Helios, Scalus, Eopsin, Hebi, and Plu-ts), and all but one of them (Plutarch) don't even use Haskell. While these alternatives can vary in efficiency from one to another, they are all *much* more efficient than PlutusTx. A good example of this is a benchmark made by OpShin (the devs behind Hebi and Eopsin) that [you can see here](https://github.com/OpShin/plutus-bench#running). It doesn't include all the PlutusTx alternatives I listed, but it does show one thing: the second least efficient smart contract language (Eopsin) included in the benchmark has 12x less script size, 48x less CPU usage, and 42x less Memory usage than the PlutusTx-written smart contract. Keep in mind, that is just the difference between the least efficient and the second least efficient, meaning the difference between PlutusTx and the others is *even greater*.

As you can see, the solutions are already here or are in development. DJED, WingRiders, SundaeSwap, and Minswap (for the most part) are all using PlutusV1 (I don't know if they are using PlutusTx or not because they are closed source). Muesliswap and JPEG store use PlutusV2, but they are written in PlutusTx. Spectrum Finance is taking a good first step in using both PlutusV2 and Plutarch, and hopefully more will follow suit.

I will note that I am aware that PlutusV2 are the PlutusTx alternatives are still relatively new (with PlutusTx alternatives still being in development), but I though that it was important to mention them anyway to show the difference that they can have for Cardano's smart contract throughput. I was thinking in particular about Input Endorsers and how its full capacity will be hindered if bloated smart contracts are still in use. It seems that Input Endorsers is years away, and in my opinion, Cardano dApps should have completely abandoned smart contracts using PlutusV1 and PlutusTx by the time Input Endorsers roll out.",2023-03-14 07:13:58

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


The third month of the year is upon us. Not too late to begin working towards your goals that you'd like to materialize this year! In the same fashion, projects across the ecosystem are working diligently towards theirs. To learn more about how some of the past Catalyst challenges have been doing so far - we've had three great presentations this week that provided insights for all of us to reflect upon. You'll find the links further below.   


Otherwise, it's very heartwarming seeing the elevated interest in all things governance. Liveliness is one of the key pillars to produce a good set of outcomes. I appreciate everyone who has engaged on the topic of Voltaire and continues doing so. Many exciting community tools are being spun up.  


I also commend everyone who continues to engage in a respectful discourse. As a whole, opinions may vary person to person. Let's make sure we always take a deep breath before responding to the other side of the argument. Let's practice pro-active listening and considerate responses.  


So - what's the latest? Dive in.

# Challenge Team Updates

This week we've seen another three distinct presentations from Challenge Teams (CTs). These teams are a fundamental piece in the puzzle to help resurface trends and insights from the past challenges that took place in the Catalyst funding rounds.  


In the most recent rounds, some of these requirements are gradually expanding, such as with the introduction of a milestones pilot in F9. It requires community endorsements on reviews for the achievement of milestones that projects submit to receive further funding. Historically, CTs have had three key deliverables. 

1. Present the concept of the specific challenge to the community when Fund begins
2. To onboard funded projects in that challenge once governance is over and the execution stage begins
3. With time passing, to reflect back on the successes, failures, insights, and learnings about challenge effectiveness and outcomes - collectively addressing a question - what return on intention has the community received? 

This week we saw presentations that address the third deliverable on the list from these teams:

* Fund 8 CT: Developer Ecosystem

In recent weeks, the overall interest in Cardano governance has increased tremendously. It is great to see civic engagement via lively, constructive discourse and debates on the proposed CIP-1694 and beyond.  


Meanwhile, as the outcome of the first workshop held in Colorado is currently being processed and will be published in the coming weeks - the community is stepping up with various initiatives to help keep the conversation going. [LidoNation](https://twitter.com/LidoNation) has introduced a [www.1694.io](http://www.1694.io/) portal, [Catalyst Swarm](https://twitter.com/CatalystSwarm) has [held a workshop](https://forum.cardano.org/t/overview-over-discussion-on-cip-1694-twenty-seven-and-a-half-open-questions/114885) and [also arranged a bounty call for translations](https://twitter.com/danny_cryptofay/status/1633539230327529480?s=20), and Governance Guild spearheaded [Voltaire News! hub](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news).   


What is Voltaire News! specifically? Check out [this timestamped segment](https://www.youtube.com/live/FpZf99M1i4M?feature=share&t=3078) from the last town hall to learn more. But in a nutshell: [a new collaborative community newslette](http://bit.ly/voltaire-news)r started by Governance Guild to help the community keep track of the CIP-1694 debate.  


If you fancy another set of views - I recommend reviewing 'let's talk governance' twitter space held by Charles Hoskinson (CEO of IOG) this past weekend. You can catch all (almost) [three hours of it here](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1632211572511711232?s=20).

The second meeting of the community dRep Book Club met on March 8, 2023 to discuss this book: The Power of Experiments. In The Power of Experiments: Decision-Making in a Data-Driven World, Michael Luca and Max Bazerman explore the value of experiments and the ways in which they can improve organizational decisions. Drawing on real-world experiments and case studies, Luca and Bazerman show that going by gut is no longer enough—successful leaders need frameworks for moving between data and decisions. [Recording from this discussion can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITZ8nF03vAU) \- learn more how it might apply to Catalyst and possible ethical questions this could raise.

It always pays to lift the head from time to time and look around what others are building - what challenges are they facing, if any lessons learned could be applied. One of the places I like to visit is Ethereum, and more specifically their somewhat equivalent of Catalyst - by name of Gitcoin. Recently, they've published a new way of how to combat bad actors and sybil resistance. Gitcoin is interesting because it has been iterating for a while on quadratic approaches to funding. A point of conversation in Catalyst as well.  


This is a ***""Gitcoin Passport""*** Case study:  


*""Numerous Internet-based social entities need help ensuring each individual is a real person and does not set up multiple accounts. Sybil attacks rely on an attacker creating numerous identities that are not easily distinguishable from legitimate users. By creating a mechanism to detect and reject these false identities, web3 communities can be kept safe from malicious actors.""*

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

756,"'m staking on my Daedalus wallet and currently delegating to a pool of specific ispo's.

The other day, I saw an article about a person who lost all their coins due to the exploitation of ledger's smart contract, and it made my heart hurt.

Therefore, a question arose, but ispo only grants claim rights to wallets that have delegated a specific epoch, but some ispo projects (sundae swap riso, etc.) connect wallets to official sites, etc. and requires a process to claim tokens in a smart contract.

If the project itself was a scam, I think there is a possibility that a malicious smart contract could compromise the entire wallet.

If the ispo token is airdropped to your wallet, you don't need to compromise your wallet.

Why don't all ispo projects distribute tokens with aidrop?",2023-03-13 06:11:25

Let’s go….

Newly Covered Today:

1. CMC is tweeting about IOG’s Sidechain toolkit? [https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1634773712468852736](https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1634773712468852736) 
2. Now we’re dealing with U.S. bank runs. Among the casualties was Silicon Valley Bank where Centre (the Circle/Coinbase joint entity that issues USDC) was keeping $3.3 billion of the $43ish billion backing USDC. Signature Bank was also shut down by regulators.

6. Yellen said NO to a bailout for SVB on Sunday. She’s obviously got bigger macro concerns. But, it’s funny how that fits perfectly with a strategy of suppressing stablecoins generally.

758,"Without being a developer or programmer, is there a way for casual Cardano users to audit the smart contracts they've interacted with in the past, or that their wallet may still be (perhaps unknowingly) interacting with?  Either through something like Cardoscan or through one's wallet itself?

There are a few examples that come to mind, but it seems like the knowledge would transferable to many more situations:

* [JPG.store](https://JPG.store) bills itself as a ""non-custodial"" NFT marketplace, however when listing an NFT for sale, the token in question appears to leave a user's wallet, seemingly contradicting the marketplace's premise.  Taking the NFT off the marketplace returns the token to one's wallet, and presumably upon sale one would receive ADA to their wallet instead, however is there a way to ""read"" the contract (as opposed to simply verifying that the contract on your computer screen and hardware wallet screen match) to see what exactly the parameters are that you're agreeing to?
* Sundae Swap had a pretty messy ICO, however users are now able to claim their rewards.  There's been a number of users who have reported seeing that the smart contract they interacting with to claim their rewards is requesting *sending* tens of thousands of SUNDAE to get their own (tens of) SUNDAE.  While it's possible this is sloppy wording innocently related to the UTXO on Sundae Swap's end, in crypto it's commonly understood that a trustless approach is the wisest.  How would one more precisely scrutinize what Sundae Swap's smart contract is asking of them?
* Speaking of trustless, is it in ***any way*** possible for a smart contract to include a time-delay, or for it to be changed after the fact (vs. being instant and/or immutable)?  If we assume a more malicious intent, or even simple ineptness, what if JPG Store suddenly shuttered its windows?  Would users automatically get back their listed NFTs in lieu of being able to ask the marketplace to take down their listing?  If a user agrees to a smart contract they don't fully understand, is it possible they *think* they've spent a nominal transaction fee (say, 2 ADA), but the full contract actually says that after X days their wallet sends an additional Y ADA to a third-party wallet (or that the contract has been changed after the fact for this to be the case)?",2023-03-12 18:56:22

And what about the ADA holders who delegated their decision-making authority to the DReps, should they be rewarded as well? Let's think about this and look for answers.

# TLDR

* CIP-1694 has elements of direct and representative democracy. 
* We should honor the principle of 1 ADA = 1 vote, but this does not necessarily apply to the size of the reward.
* All DReps should be rewarded fairly, even those with a smaller stake, but at the same time, we need to consider the size of the stake.
* If all ADA holders are not rewarded, but only DReps, the system relies on ADA holders not being greedy and behaving responsibly.
* Most people will behave rationally when voting because they are making decisions about their own wealth.

767," Hi Lads,

&#x200B;

Sorry if this has been mentioned in the Crypto Forum but I couldnt post due to my limited karma.  To me as an average user this post has been the most alarming  security issue that I have ever seen. Sorry for being alarmed but its just my point of view.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11oenu9/my\_wallet\_has\_been\_hacked\_for\_270000\_usd\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/11oenu9/my_wallet_has_been_hacked_for_270000_usd_please/)

In short, He signed a transaction on his ledger with a set amount and he actually gave someone permission to sign a contract on his behalf, which eventually drained his USDC.

Lads do ye think this is extremely vulnerable to an average user ,me included. We're looking for adoption. Anyone could make this mistake. And I'm not talking about reddit users who know the ins and outs of the technology. I thought I was solid once I had my cold wallet but I'm a bit thrown back by this.

So the few questions I have?

Is it just an ERC20 smart contract issue?

How do you spot something like this?  I hear people talking about ""modified functions"", which goes way over my head. If im signing a transaction I check the amount, fee amount and address.  What else should i be looking out for?

Again we are talking about a revolutionary technology that's supposed to change the world and to have mass adoption.",2023-03-12 19:01:02

I am very much a Bitcoin guy - I understand (at least on a basic level) what it does, why people would want to buy it and why it will potentially be worth more in the future.

Blockchains such as Cardano go straight over my head. There seems to be a a lot of talk of smart contracts, scalability and TPS but I have not been able to find a straight answer on why this is game changing technology and what value this is going to add to the world in the coming decades.

Admittedly I own a little bit of ADA and ALGO and have tried to engage with the ecosystems. I have staked my ADA, participated in Algorand governance, played around with an Algorand DeFi platform (Yieldly for anybody familiar) and swapped my coins for a bunch of tokens that didn't do anything, bought an NFT and plan on checking out voting through the Yoroi wallet. But I can't help but feeling like none of this has any real-world application.

I want to spend this crypto winter studying up on crypto and get my head around a bunch of concepts I didn't get last time.

Newly Covered Today:

1. Big Pey is launching something called Atrium Lab. [https://twitter.com/bigpeyYT/status/1633830948575010816](https://twitter.com/bigpeyYT/status/1633830948575010816) 
2. Believe it or not…legal systems made up entirely by coders may not be optimal. Incredibly, the study of law is actually a fully developed centuries old academic discipline that lies outside of JavaScript and Python. Unless you have full anonymity, you WILL be cross-chain bridged to IRL law. Some DAOs will learn this the hard way. [https://twitter.com/lex\_node/status/1633925979004436481](https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1633925979004436481) 
3. The NY Attorney General just filed against Kucoin for being an unregistered broker-dealer. Here’s the important part: they’re alleging that ETH is a security and a commodity. Their argument is not complex...it’s very straightforward. [https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/Myyp0yz/kucoin-pdf) 
4. Silvergate was a failure of fractional reserve banking, not of crypto. [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1633608132713938945](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1633608132713938945) 
5. The current US Administration’s Budget seeks to eliminate tax loss harvesting for crypto, add a 30% tax on energy used in crypto mining, hike capital gains taxes on high earners, and beam us directly to clown world with an unrealized gains tax on high earners. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget\_fy2023.pdf](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf) 
6. The subcommittee hearing on “the Administration’s Attack” on crypto went about like expected. Paul Grewal of Coinbase along with Prof. Evans of Penn State Law made some persuasive pleas for regulatory clarity. The “Anti-Crypto Party”™ also brought out their favorite witness from Duke.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4\_KwNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUUy4_KwNU) 
7. Rep. Emmer (Pro-Crypto) called the current regulatory approach “lazy & destructive…that is chilling innovation.” [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5670) 
8. Rep. Foster (Anti-Crypto):  “this is the essential thing that has to be provided for the healthy development of the crypto industry…somewhere there has to be an API provided by a trusted 3rd party to register your crypto wallets.” Why not just completely neuter crypto? [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5266](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5266) 
9. Rep. Ritchie Torres (Pro-Crypto) pointed out offshore deregulated overleveraged centralized crypto companies pose the greatest risk to consumers. But, the regulators don’t focus there. They incredibly only attack the onshore entities. He also pointed out the absurdity of the idea a stablecoin is a security. (Sadly there’s the Section 2(a)(1) exposure).  [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=5703) 
10. Rep. Davidson (Pro-Crypto) shamed his anti-crypto colleagues for their implied claims that these assets are the same as centralized assets and came out strongly supporting self-custody and pointed out there was no FTX risk if you self-custodied your assets. “We have people overtly trying to make self-custody illegal.”  [https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4\_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034](https://www.youtube.com/live/aOUUy4_KwNU?feature=share&t=6034)

10. SEC Do Kwon complaint alleges that Luna,UST, MIR, & wLuna are all securities.

28. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

37. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-03-10 06:30:10
796,"Ergonauts are warning not to send more than 20 different tokens in a single tx to a ledger because that would make the box (utxo) too large for ledger's memory to access.

In the past, there have been several cases of people losing their digital assets because hackers managed to exploit the vulnerabilities of blockchain wallets. It is important to note that this is not the fault of the blockchain itself, but of the team responsible for developing the hacked wallet. The security of your digital assets depends on choosing the right wallet and, most importantly, your behavior. Let's take a look at what Cardano as a network is responsible for in protecting digital assets, what wallet developers are responsible for, and what you can do.

# TLDR

* The Cardano network will not allow a third party to steal your property or restrict you from disposing of it.
* Cardano separates user data (digital assets) from the provided services. The interface to the service (wallets) can be provided by any third party.
* It is up to you to protect your digital assets through seed.
* Cardano can never be hacked when it comes to protecting your assets and the right to dispose of them freely.

# What's the difference between Cardano and Twitter?

The wallet is the interface to the blockchain. If you need to receive or send assets, you control the wallet in a similar way to, say, Twitter. Twitter is a social network. At its core, it's just a protocol that you access through a mobile app or web browser. That's the interface for you to Twitter. You can read other users' tweets and at any time you can write your own tweet for the whole world to see. Through the interface, you enter instructions that the protocol executes as you wish. There is a fundamental difference between Twitter and a blockchain wallet. Twitter is a centralized entity that is responsible for the protocol and infrastructure. The protocol is built on a client-server architecture. The company owns the servers that users connect to through an interface that is also supplied by Twitter. It can be said that Twitter has control over the protocol, the infrastructure, and also the interface. One implication is that you don't digitally own a Twitter account. You only have access to it through your login credentials. How is blockchain different? Let's explain it on Cardano.

This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

818,"Cardano switched to Proof-of-Stake consensus on July 29, 2020. This was in epoch 208 and the first block was minted by one of the Genesis pools operated by IOG. The block had a Height of 4,490,511. 10 days later, the first community pool minted a block. The pool had the ticker 1PCT6. This occurred in epoch 211 and slot 449. Shortly after, in slot 729, the second block minted by the community pool occurred. The pool had the ticker CRDNS and was operated by Cardanians. The third place belongs to the pool with the ticker JAPAN2. Let's add that there were 400 pools up and running when Cardano switched to PoS. Today, all the blocks are minted by community pools. There are 3200 registered pools, and approximately 1200 of them produce blocks. At the time of writing the article is missing about two days before the small anniversary. Cardano will soon celebrate 4,000,000 blocks minted through the PoS consensus.

# TLDR

* So far, Cardano needed no coordinated restart of the network. There was no major issue related to PoS.
* Cardano mints roughly 4,320 blocks per day.
* So far, PoS has successfully passed the test of time for the third year.

Welcome to the Cardano Daily Discussion!

*The standard sub rules apply here (see sidebar), with the exception that price discussion is allowed in this thread, though we encourage you to try not to make this the focus and talk about the project itself. Please ask questions, help others and be civil - be sure to get involved in Project Catalyst too!*

If you're new, please make sure you're read through the [**newbies guide**](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lnj5ne/getting_started_guide_a_newbies_guide_to_cardano/hhcvkc6/?context=3) and share it with others (use the `?newbies` comment command to reference it).

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Cheers all",2023-03-08 06:30:10

830,"There will only be 45,000,000,000 ADA coins in the Cardano ecosystem. New ADA coins will gradually be released from the reserve and eventually, we will get to the point of having almost all coins in circulation. People believe that cryptocurrencies could serve as money that could hold value in the long term. Do you know how such an economy would work? Very differently than you know it today, and you might not like it. The price of goods could gradually decrease. Wages would gradually fall in nominal terms. It would be more difficult to repay debt. It might be impossible for governments to solve sudden serious problems economically. It is inconceivable for the present indebted governments to transform an inflationary economy into a deflationary one. Moreover, how can we create a new economy that is fair for all who want to join it? Algorithmic stablecoins may be the only possible way to create better money. ADA, like BTC and other similar coins, can be an amazing reserve currency, but it will probably never be a good medium of exchange.

# TLDR

* It was necessary to abandon the gold standard in order to stimulate the economy. 
* Are you ready to live debt-free? You may be, but governments are not. 
* It would be difficult for people to change their thinking if we switched to deflationary money. 
* Users can use DJED as a medium of exchange while holding ADA as a store of value. The Cardano ecosystem will provide both functions.
* All assets in the world are volatile, including gold. There is no reason to think that ADA or BTC will be more stable than existing assets.
* Cryptocurrencies can be a good store of value if we use their value for something useful. One of the most useful tools in the world is currency.

# How would a currency with a fixed monetary policy work?

Deflationary money refers to a monetary system where the value of money increases over time, leading to a decrease in the general price level. In other words, with deflationary money, the purchasing power of money increases over time. Each unit of currency can buy more goods and services than before. Cryptocurrency fans believe this is a desirable feature for a medium of exchange. Who wouldn't want to have more for not doing anything? Just keep the money and the individual would get rich. One of the current false narratives around cryptocurrencies is that such money is better than inflationary fiat currencies. However, one must see the difference between a medium of exchange and a store of value. These functions of money cannot be combined together to work well in the long term.

46. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

55. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

First of all mobile so excuse my formatting. 
I have a (maybe dumb) questions. I saw on coincodex site (desktop version) that the inflation rate is 7.5% but the staking reward rate is +-3,5%.

But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

55. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

842,"I have an agricultural organization (small scale) in Uganda that focuses on animal breeding, meat production, tree planting (for both lumber and carbon offset).

One of the annoying aspects is wiring money through my bank. It's always a hassle and costs 50 dollars a transaction. I'm curious if anyone has experience using crypto from the states to African countries. Do they have access to exchanges that easily connect to their bank?

Also curious about any other projects people would recommend that I look into (similar to world Mobile token. I think that's really cool but it seems like it's strictly in Zanzibar)

I Would like to utilize the power and convenience of crypto on this project.

Any advice is appreciated.",2023-03-06 17:56:05

# Hello there, beautiful soul!

Hope this message finds you well.  


It is that time of the week when you get to catch up on all things Catalyst. A lot is happening and the ecosystem is as busy as ever. It's literally challenging to keep up with all the fantastic work that the communities continue to do. With all seriousness, none of Cardano would be possible as it is today without the contributions of every one of you. Here's the virtual high five for you. Keep up the great work - I see you.   


Meanwhile, this week during town hall - we've seen awesome presentations from [Discord Social Credential](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=570); [CardanoPress - ISPO Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=853); [Catalyst Swarm DAO tools](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=1285) and a great progress update from [Cyber Security Community Support](https://www.youtube.com/live/M35dcIh4yGc?feature=share&t=1771). When asked about the number one security tip? Just don't click links if you don't know what you're doing. Definitely worth a listen and follow. However, there's a whole world outside this one town hall. So what has been happening?  


Let's dive into what's the latest.

# Catalyst Circle Updates 

https://preview.redd.it/dycm5m9xk5ma1.png?width=2038&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6f5b1c06c17dac5a6501dfcfd6c3aaf7049b7037

Catalyst Circle V4 is well and truly up and running and while the representatives haven’t been featured on Town Hall since the voting ended, their collective work is taking shape and it certainly isn’t going unnoticed.  


The Catalyst Circle monitors the current state and future plans regarding Catalyst, aiming to detect and discuss concerns, objections and opportunities arising within the Catalyst ecosystem. Last week, in addition to establishing an evergreen Project Catalyst Circle handle on Twitter [@ProjectCCvX](http://twitter.com/projectCCvx), the Circle held an objective-setting workshop to form a set of directions that the reps propose to work on. The group also collaborated on a mission statement for Catalyst CircleV4:  


*CC: Our mission \[during our tenure\] is to create a centralized and standardized information management system and operational plan that is machine-readable and accessible through a one-stop-shop website that presents our organization's activities clearly and concisely*  


https://preview.redd.it/cww7dskyk5ma1.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3615e8428625b76142812e8d0df9744952f4e432

Other key ideas that arose from the workshop included creating a set of Catalyst Circle deliverables and metrics that can be measured and quantified. Also for Circle reporting and outputs (such as meetings, transcripts, and other data) to be accessible and reusable by the community. Importantly the representatives see the need to develop a Catalyst Circle framework, giving structure to their roles and responsibilities that they can hand over to the next community-elected representatives later in 2023.  


The Catalyst Circle will next be working to refine and better define the Catalyst Circle code of conduct which sets out the expectations and topics for individuals coming together to play an important role as an advisory body to Catalyst.  


Meanwhile - make sure to follow their Twitter account where you'll catch some of their messaging. Or fancy a question? They are now just a tag away at your service. [Give them follow here](https://twitter.com/ProjectCCvX) and share their profile wide.

What are the key questions being asked here?

* 🌟How do you manage your Catalyst projects?
* 🌟What tools and processes do you use?
* 🌟What would you want from a project-management dApp?

Group is conducting research into different approaches to project management in Catalyst, as part of [their F9 proposal *Open dApp Framework.*](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421050) 

* **When?** Tuesday, Mar 7 @ 4PM UTC
* **Focus?** *“Which project management tools are people using?”* 
* **Registration link** \- [http://bit.ly/3Z8goB0](http://bit.ly/3Z8goB0)
* **Miro Board link** \- [http://bit.ly/3xK0aSC](http://bit.ly/3xK0aSC)

This is a stand-alone session - you don’t need to have attended session 1 - but if you’re interested, [you can watch session 1 here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kRuWo1M45I) In Session 2, the topic will be about the tools you're currently using, any that you have tried, and how they worked for you. 

Further, looking after your privacy and your authorship - questions won't be about any proprietary information, and the data you will provide will be credited to you unless you prefer to stay anonymous.

There's no “one-size-fits-all” in project management - so whatever your approach to it, come and join in! 😊

# Voltaire/CIP-1694

https://preview.redd.it/xxi6pc66l5ma1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c80177f7273f9b31f1be5b9f4ec9fbe8ed8d904f

Last week, a community-led roundtable took place on [the topic of CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). You can catch the recap and outcome in last week’s newsletter or this [Cardano Forum recap here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/overview-over-discussion-on-cip-1694-twenty-seven-and-a-half-open-questions/114885). Worth a read.  


This week, a number of community members attended a focused technical workshop in Colorado (run by the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO and IOG) to review the mechanics of CIP 1694, the first in a number of community consultations planned for this year.  


Outputs from the meeting are now being collated and will be shared in due course for further community input. Meanwhile, here are some of the tweets I caught.

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/plc89oael5ma1.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24a1db89a35e011035fa2d0823610b1c94493b6b

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

845,"Hello Everyone! I don't think I have share my Cardano Project on here yet. Thought I would do so.

I am providing Cyber Security Support to the Cardano Community for one year under my Catalyst Project. I started this on 1Nov2022, and will last until 31Oct2023. I will likely continue afterwards, but maybe not via Catalyst.

**I would ask each of you to check out my YouTube page and subscribe. I already have some very useful information uploaded.** [**https://www.youtube.com/@epochsec**](https://www.youtube.com/@epochsec)

You can also check out my other information:

Twitter - **holymacaronee** (my main account) and **epochsec\_io** (my project account)

[epochsec.io](https://epochsec.io) \- my main website which is the central place to find any doc/content/recordings/etc that I do.

[epochsec.gitbook.io](https://epochsec.gitbook.io) \- docs are here if you prefer this as well.

A little short summary of the overall points of interest:

1) I do twitter spaces every Sunday @ 0930 EST (done quite a few so far, 23-25), and joined many others.

2) I also hold meetings. I have met with at least 18 or more individuals and teams in Cardano. My support ranges greatly from basic questions, to routine support.

3) I have my website, epochsec(.)io where I centrally post everything, other than individual/team meetings.

4) I also post my document on there, but epochsec.gitbook(.)io as well. 5) I have now been doing YT as well, to give people that version of consuming knowledge and information. The YT channel covers security and related topics as well. Sometimes it does and will involve community members and Cardano Content, when Security Information is related. But this is done to help our Cardano Community.

5) And I also started doing 5min security tips every Friday on Cardano Over Coffee.",2023-03-06 14:02:37

847,"The Cardano ecosystem is preparing to launch decentralized governance (on-chain governance). Therefore, new roles will be introduced: a constitutional committee and delegation representatives (DReps). Each ADA holder will be able to register themselves as a DRep. SPOs can become DReps if they register. Similar to how ADA holders delegate coins to pools, it will be possible to delegate decision-making power to DReps. Just as the number of blocks that a pool mint depends on the total stake, the amount of decision-making power will depend on the number of coins delegated to DReps. Why is the role of DReps important to Cardano?

**TLDR**

* Choosing a DRep will be a similar process to choosing a pool.
* DReps should have good expert knowledge and moral credit to become a representative of ADA holders. 
* On-chain governance can be much more flexible in the exchange of DReps than is the case with the conventional government.
* Decentralization is about the distribution of power, just like democracy. 
* Cardano should be first and foremost a community that uses and cares for the technology solutions and ecosystem.
* The team within each blockchain project can be seen as a center of power. If this center of power is to be weakened, someone must take over its decision-making power.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

&#x200B;

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

I want to stake my ADA for profits and security of the network but I don't want to lose them ofc. Any advice?

Thanks in advanced!",2023-03-05 12:35:27

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

869,"A few different blockchains have ""gaming guilds"" for people interested in web3 games to share information between each other and help support gaming projects in their ecosystems. Additionally, there are many blockchain-independent gaming guilds as well

I was wondering, is there a Cardano Gaming Guild? I found one on Twitter, but it seems they never actually launched (dead website, no recent tweets). Cardano already has some games live (Paima Studios, SuperBull, Mocossi Planet) and seemingly multiple more in development, so it would make sense that there is some NPO to promote gaming on Cardano

26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world.

28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

30. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
31. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano. [https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457](https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1623825932011155457)

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

36.

I have been trying to open up my Daedalus wallet these last couple of days after not opening it up for a  very long time. Every time it says I don't have enough free space in my hard drive. I then go free up space and it loads up for a couple of hours and then it stops working, asking for more space. This happens each time I open it up. Is there a way to fix this problem?

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

&#x200B;

[Ongoing 'giveaway' scams on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/0wjjzhg4lxj71.png?width=1311&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b03d5f6c8ce7582f007426aed7def3cbbb85bd4)

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

A platform that allows projects to launch decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) quickly has been developed, which is known as Summon. The platform is based on Cardano’s Plutus-Core technology and a strong understanding of off-chain code to enable decentralised coordination and governance.",2023-03-02 18:56:22
885,"**Cardano Tale: The Magical Adventure of the NFTs**

Once upon a time in a magical world, there lived a group of friends named Charles, Pi, Lukas, Tommy, Duncan, and Samuel. They loved exploring new things in their world, which was full of wonders and magic.

One day, they stumbled upon a treasure chest that was filled with sparkling cards. These cards were not ordinary cards, they were special, and each had a unique magical power. The cards were called NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens.

https://preview.redd.it/tiud65xl4dla1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f6cf6e033cc0ad674e831b386d91c399c099a847

The group of friends had never seen anything like it before. Charles, the leader of the group, knew that they had found something special. He explained to his friends that these cards were called NFTs and were very valuable.

Pi, the curious one, asked, ""Why are these cards so valuable? They look just like ordinary cards to me.""

Charles smiled and said, ""These cards are special because they are unique, and they cannot be duplicated. It's like having a one-of-a-kind treasure that no one else has.""

Lukas, the tech-savvy one, suggested they find out more about NFTs and their magical powers. So, they all went on a quest to learn more about NFTs.

On their journey, they met a wise old wizard named Tommy. He told them that NFTs were created using a magical technology called Cardano. The technology was so advanced that it allowed people to create unique digital assets, like the NFTs they had found.

Duncan, the brave one, asked, ""Can we create our own NFTs?""

Tommy nodded and said, ""Yes, you can! With the power of Cardano, you can create your own unique NFTs and add your own magical powers to them.""

Excited by the possibility of creating their own NFTs, the group of friends decided to use their creativity to make their own special NFTs. Samuel, the artist of the group, created a beautiful NFT with his magical paintbrush. Charles used his leadership skills to make a rare NFT, and Lukas used his tech skills to create a unique NFT that no one had ever seen before.

The friends were amazed by what they had accomplished. They had created their own magical NFTs and had learned about the power of Cardano. They were grateful for their adventure and couldn't wait to see what other magical things they could create using their newfound knowledge.

And from that day on, the group of friends continued to explore the wonders of their magical world and all the exciting things they could do with NFTs and Cardano technology.

886,"ChatGPT has taken the world by storm. Within 5 days, 1 million users had tried the app. In two months, it had more than 100 million users. That's a new world record for how quickly people adopted the service. 13 million people use the app every day. Converted to TPS, that would be 150. AI is used by about 50 times more people per day than Bitcoin. New startups are emerging literally every day and want to use AI for their business. It is almost certain that AI will change the world within the next decade. Wait, didn't they say the same thing about blockchain? Why is blockchain adoption so slow compared to ChatGPT? If you look into history, you will find that AI and blockchain have roots in the distant past. Cardano can be considered a publicly available solution, with decades of development behind each technology that is used. It's good to know that if a killer application emerges, the world can adopt it very quickly. Just as AI is celebrating mass success with ChatGPT, the blockchain industry is sure to succeed. We just need to keep on developing technology and finding applications. Come see what AI and blockchain have in common in terms of technology development and what that could mean for Cardano.

# TLDR

* People believe that the history of blockchain projects dates back to the time of their launch. These projects use technologies that are much older.
* The AI industry had to go through an ""AI winter"" lasting more than a decade. The blockchain industry may experience a “crypto winter” before it succeeds. 
* The evolution of the blockchain industry has certainly not stopped with the launch of Bitcoin. Smart contracts, tokenization, PoS, and decentralized governance are all things that came after Bitcoin.
* We are waiting for ChatGPT of the blockchain industry.
* Bitcoin is not the first attempt to create a cryptocurrency. It's hard to imagine it being the last possible attempt.
* The idea of a decentralized global computer is sound and if Cardano fails people will make another attempt. But Cardano is still at the beginning, so it's a successful project so far.

# The history of AI will help us understand the blockchain industry

It may surprise you to know that AI technology has its roots in the 1950s and it has been used in industry for decades. ChatGPT is only the first publicly available app that has succeeded en masse. Take a look at how AI has evolved and what the industry has had to go through to the present day where we can use it for our own purposes for free. The modern concept of AI emerged in the 1950s with the development of computers and the theory of computation. Mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing proposed the ""Turing Test"" in 1950, which became a fundamental concept in AI research.

26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world.

28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

900,"Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital form of fiat money issued by a central bank. We believe you have all heard of this phenomenon. Many central banks around the world are in the research phase, development phase, or have completed their first pilot programs. CBDCs are even already in use in three countries and their number will almost certainly grow in the coming years. Some experts warn that CBDC poses risks associated with loss of privacy, or it may even be a tool for governments to control residents. Why should people adopt CBDC in the first place? Wouldn't we be better off using stablecoins on Cardano? To know the answers, we need to look at why central banks are working on CBDCs. Let's compare CBDC with stablecoins on Cardano. Can these two technologies coexist?

# TLDR

* CBDCs can be tokenized similarly to USD-backed stablecoins.
* It is not necessary to look at CBDC and blockchain as two competing solutions but as complementary networks.
* The CBDC effectively suppresses the right to privacy as well as the right to possess value. Transactions through the Cardano ecosystem can be private and you can own the value.
* Central banks can retain full control over monetary policy while giving people the freedom to choose what specific networks to use.
* CBDC tokenization will allow the separation of the needs of central banks from the right to privacy and self-custody.
* Central banks could mint at least part of the CBDC on SC platforms to make it easier for people to access.

26. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)
27. Rumors are that other exchanges & stablecoin providers will receive letters outlining charges soon. One posted rumor is mentioning Circle (USDC) & Paxos specifically. [https://twitter.com/AP\_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322](https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1623785788725944322)
28. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem. [https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656](https://twitter.com/jessebabies/status/1615769704353734656)

30. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
31. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

36. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

42. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy.

81. In the class action suit against Dapper Labs (creators of CryptoKitties) alleging the NBA Top Shot Moments NFTs are securities, the court has denied the motion to dismiss. This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief. This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

Currently looking at Nomad but have to complete KYC.
Would prefer to not have to complete KYC .
Most other chains can move assets to and from each other quite easily.
I believe that this stifles adoption for Cardarno.
I really like what Cardarno stands for as well as their approach to development. But this is a fair criticism of Cardarno at the moment.

916,"Every Cardano supporter knows that there will only be 45,000,000,000 ADA coins. ADA is a scarce resource. For many, it is a store of value or the money of the future. The immutability of monetary policy is a fundamental principle for any blockchain. If it were to be violated, it would have fatal consequences on people's trust in the project. There is a direct link between scarcity and blockchain security. The market value of coins determines the quality of blockchain security. If security starts to decline, a change in monetary policy may be necessary as one possible solution. The choice between security or scarcity is a dilemma that would be very uncomfortable for the community. Is it possible to have a long-term economically sustainable blockchain without having to change scarcity? What mechanisms prevent a change in the monetary system and why is governance important? 

# TLDR

* Monetary rules can exist forever, no matter what technology is used to enforce and maintain them. 
* In order of importance, rules come first, community second, and technology third.
* Maintaining scarcity essentially means making a key decision in times of crisis and changing the protocol in time.
* Scarcity can only be sustained economically in the long run through a sufficient security budget.
* Those who are able to manage resources more efficiently have a better chance of survival.
* The choice between scarcity and security is a choice that the community does not want to have, as they may not agree on a solution.
* All ADA holders together are responsible for both security and scarcity.

# How to maintain scarcity?

Change is the only constant we can completely rely on in our universe. This is doubly true for technological progress. Blockchain protocols have the ambition to exist for several decades, perhaps forever. People are not interested in a particular protocol in terms of its design, implementation, or technological maturity, but mainly because of the financial and social opportunity it brings. They want monetary policy, decentralization and its associated features, protocol security, the ability to connect people without third parties, etc. to remain unchanged. Unfortunately, this cannot (very likely) be achieved without changing the protocols and their specific properties. Negative developments may force a change in rules that were intended to remain unchanged forever. To ensure the security of the protocol, it may be necessary to change monetary policy.

Pulsar Finance is about to launch on Cardano. To do some final tests they are looking for some Cardano testers.  


Pulsar Finance, allows you to track all your assets in one single place, from Tokens, Defi positions (farm, LPs, debt) and NFTs. They have already added support for over 40 Cosmos chains, TRON, NEAR and Aurora and will now be adding support for Cardano. You can see what they have done so for for other ecosystems here: pulsar.finance  


Therefore they are looking to find Cardano users to test their Alpha version before they go live in the next couple of days.

32. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

34. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

928,"Some may mistakenly think that if you want to write smart contracts for Cardano you have to learn Haskell. You can go that route, or use one of the emerging alternatives. One of these is Aiken, a new programming language and toolkit for developing smart contracts on Cardano. Aiken will be a full-featured platform that allows you to write a smart contract quickly including detailed error messages and conveniently with all the necessary tools.

**TLDR**

* Aiken focuses only on the on-chain part of the application.
* Aiken will allow you to write and run the ""Hello, World!"" app in 10 minutes.
* The on-chain part of the application can be written in any language as long as there is a compiler that translates the code into Plutus Core.
* The compiler works similarly to a language translator.
* An Alpha release with the first pioneers is scheduled for Q1 2023.

929,"Good morning , Can you give some information , a while ago i wanted to withdraw my money from deadalus to put it on binance. the customer service asked me to pay 4% of my assets to be able to withdraw the money as i did not have all the funds my wife to send some of the money asking the customer service of deadalus if she could. today deadalus said that we had no right because I for my part did not report it and that it is considered money laundering. and asks me to pay an 8% penalty but I don't have the funds yet. I ask for a delay but want me to pay in 5 days, or he donates my assets to charities. can you help me. THANKS",2023-02-27 05:54:14

40. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)

42. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

44. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)

46. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

931,"hello-

i like to move my ADA. but is there a better way than:

1. claiming rewards
2. moving ALL away.
3. sending in new ADA 4 weeks later for GAS
4. collecting the new rewards, which were delayed given and added to the live stake, generating itself new rewards
5. go to/repeat 2. until the -new/new/new ... rewards are small enough you dont care..or GAS is higher than rescue amount

?

\-thx

i wasnt downvoting anyone. i just got back and am amazed about the constructional help in my first cardano subreddit i find here.

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.

I mean, scalability solutions via L2 (zk rollups / optimistic roll ups) are being deployed and seems the future, and Cardano is focused on Sidechains or Hydra (ok, its a L2 but not a zk or optimistic, its a channel state L2 and seems that could be technologically worse than Ethereum's L2).

We have been happy being an ""alt"" techically better than competitors, but seems that we're losing the technology battle. 

Charles Hoskinson says that L2 solutions based on rollups will be in Cardano in the future but.....

When? Is anyone working on it? 

Another key point, if Cardano wants to have big L2 solutions, it has to work in solving the ""data availability"" layer (Ethereum is working on it with the proto-danksharking solution).

This is a no FUD post, but seems like Haskell devs as Sebastian Guillemot (Milkomeda) are pointing that problem and Cardano could be ""obsolete"" in 2/3 years if they dont open its ecosystem to L2.",2023-02-26 10:07:47

947,"This doc states that in each epoch the inflation is 0.3% of the reserves, with 20% going to the Treasury: https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy

Cexplorer states the reserves have ~9.48bi ADAs now:
https://cexplorer.io/pot

This should mean 0.3%*9.48bi of rewards per epoch, or ~28.44M, right?

If we're talking about 28.44M, that means 22,75M for delegators and ~5,68M for Treasury

The same chart (and I double checked at Cardano Blockchain Insights) shows us that the Treasury is actually receiving something around 5,68M and that’s ok.

But if you check this chart again you will see that the reserves are being reduced by ~18M each epoch (decreasing each epoch, of course).

I've checked several previous epochs by looking at data from Cexplorer, Cardano Blockchain Insights and Cardanoscan, but it seems to me that delegators are getting ~10M less ADAs than they should. Or else the documentation is outdated and now the issuance is lower and Treasury gets ~30%?

Hello there, beautiful soul!  


Hope this message finds you well.  


Living in the Cardano ecosystem often feels like time travel. You blink - and there it goes. One week flies by. In that sense, it also means that it was another week of building, educating, and participating in the collective shaping of how Cardano looks like.   


This week, during town hall we've seen great presentations from [DLT 360 team and their industry onboarding efforts](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=412), [building dApps with Python](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=1538), [Chinese community building with Dumpling](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=1958), or [this amazing agreements-building platform - Consenz.](https://www.youtube.com/live/MFpdUUjwZBE?feature=share&t=2200) The ingenuity and hard work of Catalyst is shining through and we wish all the best of luck to these projects in the coming weeks and months. Well done.   


The Catalyst team also shared a quick update during this month's Cardano 360 show and you can catch [the timestamped segment here](https://youtu.be/J2UdDtqziF4?t=385). Topics? Current progress and call to action to start registering for the upcoming Special Voting Event. More details will be shared soon as well.  


I also recommend reviewing community-led governance conversations around [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380) and [Voltaire](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/) more broadly. Learn more about these further below in the '*Governance front and center'* section.  


Let's dive into what's the latest.

Catalyst Circle is working diligently to formalize its next steps and set the firm direction and the north star for its engagement within the ecosystem. There are so many directions and needs that require attention. [Lloyd Duhan](https://twitter.com/radioastro) offered to hold a special training session this week to help navigate these decisions with all the Circle members. The Circle will be sharing soon their insights with you.  


Thank you Lloyd for your leadership and willingness to help this amazing group of individuals in their pursuit of navigating the Catalyst ecosystem.

Stephanie King of Lido Nation [has shared a great milestone achievement](https://www.lidonation.com/en/posts/introducing-catalyst-explorer) from their recently funded project to build a community tool to help with resurfacing data insights in a humanly readable manner. In her words  


""The data behind the amazing numbers in Project Catalyst - the people, the projects, the results - have always been hypothetically public. However, actually accessing and understanding it has always been difficult. If you could manage to track down one of the many, it was still up to you to click through the many tabs and rows of raw data.""

Thank you all who managed to find time out of your busy lives and attend one of the two Challenge Team roundtable sessions last Thursday.  


If you are reading about Challenge Teams for the first time - these are dedicated community members that have stepped up to help onboard, monitor and report back to the community on the learnings and efficacy of Catalyst challenges. It's an important feedback loop tool that community can leverage.

As promised, please find the recordings here (including video, transcript, and chat)

* 👉 [Session A - 9AM UTC](https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/TQwwM7ye3IMlB0AeUEISUD5M-TPOx4_RWCsPgatF2-czA3mWdXbtDvbGZ_ob9Mbi.JIYKmMLYzRb23dar)

# Governance front and center 

https://preview.redd.it/jl2n8pyzz6ka1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f3e0478da93887168af35830f6a679081827e16

Last week, a community-led roundtable took place on [the topic of CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380). Maybe you ask, CIP what? CIPs - commonly known as Cardano Improvements Proposals - is a framework with which the community can formally put forth a proposal for an improvement for review in the ecosystem. You can learn about these more in the section further below that summarizes weekly updates from the CIP world.  


Circling back to [the CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380) community workshop - as [Zoe from Swarm ](https://twitter.com/AnimaValeska)reviews:  


""First, in the plenum, we discussed what the CIP process actually is and how it works. We then distributed ourselves into breakout rooms on the topics of dReps, Constitutional committee, SPOs, and inclusivity/accessibility of specific communication and information.""  


""During the wrap-up, we discussed some further broad governance questions; and after the “official” (more or less lol) session we also raised and collected more concerns. Overall, it has been a very broad and rich discussion on all things Voltaire! Lastly, we collectively collected points raised as good as possible [as sticky notes on the following Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPv2UmUI=/).""  


You can get the full recording of this session [via this youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21Xhzgta1xk). Also recommended some additional perspectives from these videos:

* [Army of Spies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWFZYgmiAg); [Jspeak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXM1Pxd0hgQ); [QA DAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe9XvezpdbI); [Voltaire Discussions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLhhOVXQOg); [Exploring Dynamic Governance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfAUD4rNFJs)
* **Not sure how GitHub can be used?** [**This video**](https://youtu.be/BmdddVHjCX0) **will help you.**

On a related theme, next week, a number of SPOs and developers (including some from the Catalyst community) will attend a focused technical workshop in Colorado (run by the Cardano Foundation and IOG) to review the mechanics of CIP 1694, the first in a number of community consultations planned for this year.  


Full meeting minutes will be published after the event for further community engagement and feedback. If you wish to add your perspectives to CIP 1694, you can find it [here](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/380).  


Make sure you add your voice as the era of Voltaire rolls out!

# Workshops for funded projects

https://preview.redd.it/xu3y444a07ka1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ff9c8cea6b7830ce3b08d2e6c76c1a23ce4187b0

Last week, we announced the Funded Project Workshops on technical and business growth topics focused on empowering project owners funded by Catalyst. The goal is to develop the skills and the right frameworks to complete their projects and be successful in the ecosystem.  


This week, the funded projects had the first of these workshops, titled: **Business Models for Disruptive Emerging Tech Businesses** presented by Harry Hellyer from Edify Collabs. The session focused on finding the best ways to express the value created by your team, its products, and services — to yourselves, your customers, partners, and investors.  


Fundamentally, the funded projects present during the session went through an exercise to get under the hood of their value propositions and identify the value they bring and the ecosystems it is best suited for.  


For more on the session, check out the video recording here: [https://bit.ly/3XQ4IBm](https://bit.ly/3XQ4IBm)  


Expect more funded project workshops in the coming weeks as we aim to provide more education and resources for projects building in the Catalyst ecosystem throughout the rest of the year. These workshops are going to be made available soon via Catalyst YouTube Playlist as well.

# Last week in CIPs 

https://preview.redd.it/ckxpjcnb07ka1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c66e9cbee7366deef813e5fc4d9094f3acfabcfe

Here's the recap from my colleague [Ryan Williams](https://twitter.com/Ryun1_) that writes these fantastic CIP round-ups. I figured you'd like them, too. So here's the latest to get up to speed. You can catch past and future summaries [via this Cardano forum thread here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/what-happened-in-cips-last-week/109101) as well. If are unsure what CIPs are about - please check out this link to dive deeper: [https://cips.cardano.org/](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). 

**RW:** What happened in CIPs last week?

* [CIP-???? | Extendable dApp Connector](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/462) **\[New Proposal\]**:
   * This CIP proposes an alternative to CIP-30 for a *base* dApp-Wallet communication bridge whilst adding a scheme for how functionality can be enhanced.
   * I (Ryan) am an author of this 

**RW:** Continued Recommendations:

* [CIP-0057? | Plutus Smart-Contract Blueprints](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/258)
   * This proposal specifies a language for documenting Plutus contracts in a machine-readable manner. This is akin to what [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification) or [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/v2.4.0) are for, documenting HTTP services and asynchronous services respectively.
   * Lots of recent discussions here too.
* [CIP-0086? | NFT Metadata Update Oracles](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/430)
   * This proposal extends the [CIP-25](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0025) standard for defining and updating token metadata via transaction metadata, by providing a new mechanism to update token metadata without having to mint or burn tokens.
   * Interesting proposal for updating NFT (or another asset) metadata.

**Next Meeting:**

* CIP Editors Meeting #62 (next Tuesday):
   * Feb 28th 9:30am UTC.
* Held on Discord - [here](https://discord.gg/4yukWV3khD).
* Agenda TBD.

Further varied governance and Catalyst community conversations can be also followed on [the official Cardano forum here](https://forum.cardano.org/c/governance/140). Don't be shy to be part of the conversation. 

# Catalyst GitHub Repo - Weekly Round-Up

https://preview.redd.it/uhi97urd07ka1.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5129a1bac3c6c789283827932a4896afda4c892a

One of the primary objectives this year is to make it easier for Community members to understand how Catalyst works on the technical side and to access the Catalyst technical backend to increase transparency in systems. The major side effect later this year is expected to be around the ability of the community to come along and start co-creating/helping build/suggest improvements to these foundations.  


This repo is the starting point and we're seeking improvements to it throughout the months to come. For now, feel free to bookmark the pages and lurk around as we get it ready:

7. Some are raising concerns Base may be a colossal mistake since Coinbase is the only major SEC regulated crypto company and there could be many different tokens the SEC considers securities and many types of DeFi transaction traversing this L2, this could accelerate regulatory pressure on centralized L2s as broker/dealers.

40. Gensler released a video which very specifically described staking in terms of “escrow” or “if you transfer your tokens to a staking-as-a-service provider”. Neither of these is common in normal Cardano staking or delegating. But, it sounds a lot like the Ethereum staking world. [https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648](https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1623777842000539648)

42. Here’s some wild speculation from one poster: if Circle agrees to limit/censor USDC in some way, it might lead to demands from ETH users to employ some kind of social slashing, which could cause a schism (and create fork potential) in that ecosystem.

44. Charles also dropped a video explaining how (in the very worst scenario) Cardano staking could still operate via “contingent staking” even if SPOs were regulated. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7y2tvpHY5w)
45. Now the SEC is going after Binance USD stablecoin issuer, Paxos. [https://archive.ph/nrgeU](https://archive.ph/nrgeU)
46. Jessie Powell (founder of Kraken) posted “I don’t think that any minor differences matter to the SEC, which views all forms of custodial staking as problematic.” If true, this is massively bad for Ethereum and confirms the advantage in Cardano.

48. Coinbase has released a comprehensive defense against their “Earn” staking program being classified as a security under the Howey Test and vowed to fight if the SEC goes after them. While I don’t find their reasoning to be bulletproof or extremely persuasive. The value is in the commitment to fight. We need this hard line in the sand right now.

50. Here’s a fantastic thread by Sooraj explaining the huge innovative leap forward provided by Ouroboros Genesis for dynamic participation in proof-of-stake systems and making Cardano more secure than Ethereum or Algorand.

56. The messaging against the energy use in Bitcoin is fully ramping up now courtesy of Bloomberg and the Harold and Kumar guy.

This is just the court saying that if all the factual allegations are taken as true, then there is a plausible claim for relief.  This is not a ruling on the status of NFTs as securities or not. But, the judge did go through a pretty detailed analysis of Howey in the ruling which found horizontal commonality for prong 2.

#  ⚠️ Scam Warning ⚠️ 

**Please read the** [**Cybersecurity guidelines for Cardano Users**](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005141163-Cybersecurity-guidelines-for-Cardano-users)**.**

There are ongoing giveaway scams on youtube and many scammers lurking in Cardano's social channels impersonating ambassadors/moderators/official staff contacting users via direct messages.

For example, searching 'cardano' on youtube and sorting by most recent upload date shows several giveaway scams running (all videos in screenshot are scams):

The youtube scams are automated; use stolen footage usually of Charles Hoskinson and are restreamed so to appear to be 'live'; appear to have many watchers (which are bots); use bought hacked channels and are edited to appear like official channels.

[See this post for more examples of what they look like](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/10kf1kb/cardano_scam_in_2021_all_72_screenshots/)

Do not be fooled!

**To be clear:**

* ⚠️ There is **no such thing** as a Cardano giveaway
* ⚠️ **Never** **share** your seed phrase with ANYONE
* ⚠️ **Never** **send** ADA to someone promising to send you more ADA back
* ⚠️ You **will never** be contacted by ambassadors/moderators/staff

**Please report scams on the** [**Cardano Fraud Detection Bureau**](https://cfdb.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals)**.**

# Midnight Subreddit

In anticipation of Input Output's new data protection blockchain 'Midnight', I've managed to acquire r/Midnight through some negotiation and repurpose it for the Cardano Community (the sub was created for a card game back in 2011 but was mostly unused). 

I decided to do this as I thought the project will eventually need a home on reddit and best to setup now before any scammers do. Obviously there's not much to post about on there right now as it's early days as the project is yet to be released, but if you'd like to be kept up to date on the project please feel free to join the new subreddit if the project interests you and I'll be sure to post updates as and when they become available.

Right now the sub is mostly a carbon copy of r/cardano, I've copied most of the automod and rules over, so certain aspects may seem a little incongruent atm, but I'll tailor and tweak the sub as we go. Feel free to send me or post any input if you want stuff to change.
