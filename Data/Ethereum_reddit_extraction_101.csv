6,"It’s easy to take wallets for granted without thinking about the mechanisms underneath that enable self-custody over our assets. Wallets use layers of cryptography to keep assets secure, and each level from seed to account does something fascinating.

&#x200B;

# First, Wallets

Wallets are simply ways to access accounts on blockchain networks. Accounts have addresses that funds can be sent to, public keys that prove who they are, and private keys that authorize transactions. Even more private than private keys though, are the seed phrases that create them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Where Seed Phrases Come From

A seed phrase can be represented as 12 words, but that’s not how they start. Instead, they’re created as a series of 128 bits (ones and zeros) generated at random, plus 4 extra ones. These 132 bits divide into 12 words. In essence, each word is just a way to represent 11 ones and zeros. The BIP-39 proposal defines which sequences of bits correspond to which of the 2048 words.

The randomness of the bits that make up the seed is essential to the security of its accounts. Approaches to this “entropy generation,” or randomness, can vary from one wallet provider to another. Once a seed is created though, it goes through some additional cryptographic steps to keep itself secret.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# How Private Keys are Created

Seed phrases give access to all the private keys that they create, whereas private keys only give access to specific accounts. A seed phrase is like a master key that can unlock every deposit box at your personal bank, whereas private keys only unlock one box (i.e. account) each.

Seed phrases create private keys by going through a couple of cryptographic steps. First, our seed phrases are added with some extra random data, called a salt, and passed through a hash function to create a “root key.” Hash functions take any data and represent it in a specific format, in this case 512 bits.

*Read* [*more about hash functions*](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/merkle-trees-how-blockchain-data) *in my previous write-up on Merkle Trees.*

Our 512 bit root key is then hashed again with a different function. The result is a sequence of another 512 bits that we split down the middle to create two things: the sequence on the left becomes the “master private key,” and the right sequence becomes “chain code.” The master private key can access all accounts that come from the same seed phrase, whereas the chain code serves as additional randomness that is used when new accounts are generated.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/49b7yssl0gza1.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ebd39e77abb18ca8e35e4f1d89b3a9cf109027e2

Finally, to create a private key that actually belongs to a new account (and not the seed phrase itself), we count up from 0. The first account a wallet creates will have an index number of 0, the next will have 1, and so on. We’ve gone through no less than three functions to create private keys, each serving an essential purpose for security.

&#x200B;

# How Public Keys are Generated

Public keys are generated with a method known as “elliptic curve cryptography.” This method uses an elliptic curve like the one below with a specific shape and starting point that varies from one blockchain to another. To generate a public key, a private key is represented as a number and multiplied by the starting point for that elliptic curve (and by extension, blockchain).

&#x200B;

[Source: Nick Sullivan](https://preview.redd.it/ojjq7dcn0gza1.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b3c79778c39f8320e39149956a08a09e95b8221a)

By virtue of mathematics, the resulting number is also a point on the elliptic curve. That number represents the public key. It’s practically impossible, however, to divide it to find out which starting point was used to get there. When compared to a classic form of encryption known as RSA, a study titled Universal Security [noted](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/) that “breaking a 228-bit RSA key requires less energy than it takes to boil a teaspoon of water. Comparatively, breaking a 228-bit elliptic curve key requires enough energy to boil all the water on earth.”

&#x200B;

# How Wallet Addresses are Generated

One more level of abstraction is required to go from public keys to account addresses. While blockchains could have used public keys as the addresses themselves that people share, there’s a significant security reason why the distinction today exists. An address is essentially the public key after it’s gone through some hash functions.

The hash functions hide the public key so that an account can receive funds using the address only. As long as it never broadcasts a transaction, it’s public key remains hidden. This protects the account against potential future ways to break encryption that could allow a private key to be derived from a known public key. As a result, rotating funds to accounts that remain dormant is a prudent, long-term security measure.

7,"Would you give someone access to part of your capital? I would not. Then why do we do it in Ethereum ecosystem and considering it a standard?

To use ERC-20 tokens in DeFi protocols such as Sushiswap you must approve DApp to spend tokens on your behalf - known as an allowance.

Some time ago smart contract developers come up with tiny additional standard to ERC-20 that allows DApps to ask for unlimited allowance for your tokens.

People tend to say ""funds in a wallet"", that's wrong. Funds are on-chain and your wallet is the key to do stuff on-chain.

**""Not your keys, not your crypto"" is actually not the full truth in EVM ecosystem. ERC-20 allowance means you share crypto with an approved contract – known as a spender.**

Recent bug in Sushi swap new v2 smart contract led to an exploit and users were asked to revoke allowances to secure their crypto

\[tweet link\] https://twitter.com/jaredgrey/status/1644914375151550464

**If you think hardware wallets can help, they don't.** With an allowance an approved spender can use tokens associated with your address without your keys anytime they want to.

There are some solutions like approve-spend patterns, which result in more fees. This creates another problem because gas is not cheap in Ethereum ecosystem even in L2.

Gasless spend approval ERC-2612 is another solution to the allowance problem but you have to sign an additional transaction. Uniswap recently came up with Permit2 solution when you need to approve just once for any token in their app.

Newer ERC-1155 standard only amplify the problem. ERC-1155 contracts may have more than one asset in a single contract and do have a function to delegate right to transfer all assets without any limits.

**ERC-20 allowance mechanism cannot be the future of DeFi** and especially the future of finance. We need better technology but while we build it use the amazing [Revoke.cash](https://Revoke.cash) tool to check your current allowance and check if you have any allowance in hacked smart contracts [https://dmitryshvetsov.com/apps/is-my-crypto-wallet-safe/](https://dmitryshvetsov.com/apps/is-my-crypto-wallet-safe/)

11,"What do you think about the latest innovation in the world of NFTs?   
 

From what I've heard ERC-6551 standard enables digital assets on Ethereum to overcome several current limitations by introducing token-bound accounts.   
 

Generally, I don't have so much experience with NFTs, I only use them in GameFi, I used recently MagicCraft NFT Marketplace and for now that's my only connection with NFTs.   
 

But I was curious about this innovation and I read about it online, so if anyone's interested, here are some facts about it.   
 

ERC-6551 enables NFTs to be more than static assets while retaining the advantages and features of ERC-721. The process follows converting the asset into a TBA. Token-bound accounts provide NFTs with an interface and registry for smart contract accounts based on ERC-721.   
 

Based on ERC-4337, smart accounts can be customized and used to store assets and make transactions. Furthermore, token-bound accounts record all the activities performed on the blockchain in an unalterable fashion.   
 

Even though token-bound accounts technically belong to an ERC-721 NFT, their control is delegated to the NFT's owner. An owner can initiate on-chain actions on behalf of an NFT by using a token-bound account.   
 

‍I believe that the future of ERC-6551 and token-bound accounts is promising, as it unlocks new use cases for NFTs and makes them more accessible to a broader audience.",2023-05-12 12:34:06

24,"Hello,

I am posting here just as a potential avenue towards my objective of developing a novel DeFi protocol that I have devised, while not developed as code yet, I have already outlined and come up with the full protocol design and implementation plus its future development outlook, and all I need to do now is build the MVP to go to market and it is a very basic and minimum functioning system that needs to be built that doesn't require any complex or advanced engineering but would work very well even in it's simplest form.

I have already written 2 whitepapers for this protocol, and it's really simple and works quite well in it's simplicity I think to achieve a near perfect perpetuating flywheel effect that spans into an extremely scalable and profound usecase that I think will shake up the entire space. I would consider it to be on the scope and scale of like Uniswap or Blur or Curve, while not in terms of its mathematically engineered marvel, but in terms of the platform capability and userbase function as well as envisioning meta. I would consider it a new DeFi primitive of sorts.

Although it doesn't require any proprietary technology nor algorithms or anything like that initially, it simply uses all the current tools and mechanisms already available for the most part but slightly tweaked for its specific purposes, but does so in a completely novel approach that actually makes it extremely common sense and intuitive. However, in the future, the potential to implement proprietary tech and engineering on top of it is there.

It does include a token, which uses a lot of meta tokenomics, but no scammy, presale or premint of any kind, completely fair launch and organic with a sustainable token emission model which is like literally nonexistent in the space. I think that's what sets it apart as well.

And if we did develop the MVP and have it ready to launch we could probably get some substantial VC funding but it wouldn't be with some kind of VC allocation of the tokens directly or it'd would have to be built into the protocol function to create an allocation, which can be done.

Anyway, I'm just reaching out on various subs to see if I can find anyone that might have an interest in helping me out get off the ground, because the thing is although I have everything planned out and prepared, including the frontend app UI and website design that just needs to be implemented, I myself am not adept or keen in coding by any means, but I am trying to learn. One would say I'm not highly technical as a founder, more of an executive with a vision and sense of focus on product design and UX, so I am in need of a technical cofounder or just a senior developer that can help out.

In addition, I do have funding and a sizeable budget for the timeframe and scope that is necessary for the MVP to launch, but not much runway afterwards even though we don't need any because the funding would come as soon as it's launched as I said it's extremely scalable and is really a cash generating engine (TVL potential of billions). I used to have quite a substantial amount of funding I could've put into this, but since the bear market, my assets have diminished substantially so I wouldn't be able to dish out anywhere near that large amount of funding to develop this nor would I want to with the proper development timeline necessary. I digress, I am not really concerned about funding but rather the right person for the job and to join me on this journey, otherwise I will be soloing it completely. It's more about trust and a long-term relationship that I'm looking for for something this big.

In the meantime, I am alternatively dedicating myself to learning how to code totally on my own, particularly with the help of AI using ChatGPT and other AI coding tools to try and build this out myself but I realize that's a difficult and arduous endeavor not to mention it's limited capabilities on its own and obvious security concerns. But knowing the potential impacts of this project I'm more than willing to get my hands dirty and put the time and effort in.

And I am keeping this pretty close to my chest so I won't be releasing any details until I am at least confident enough to being close to launching and having the MVP developed and then I can publish the whitepapers with it. I'm also just seeing if maybe I can garner some interest preliminarily as I get closer to launch to be able to bring onboard a team as undoubtedly I will need more than just myself working on this.

I have been iterating and carefully planning this project since 2019, from its initial inception, for which I have pivoted and changed the overall concept multiple times since then, originally it was something along the lines of Lido Finance but on a wholly different basis; whilst then I've learned about the newest protocols in DeFi and in liquidity provisioning, etc., and I have iterated on it to this final point, the culmination of over 3 years of research and learning as this emerging industry has matured to this point, I think this is the perfect timing for this project as well.

Quite honestly, I'm unsure of how exactly this will pan out or the purpose and outcome of this post, more than likely it will be glossed over or ignored if not removed, but nonetheless I'm just trying my luck and seeing what I find. So here goes nothing lol. One way or another, I strongly believe that I have something significant here so I'm just doing whatever I can to get it going.

I'm currently in the process of building the website as we speak...

Sorry for this basic question… I couldn’t find a clear explanation on internet.

By how much lower do you set the Base fee (GWEI) compared to the curent base fee on the network?

How about the Gas limit as it has a different unit measure to max base fee?

I usually set the priority fee as low as possible as I’m not in a rush for my transactions (I don’t mind to wait even 1-2 days to the transaction to be completed).

However sometimes I set base fee (or gas limit?) too low so the transaction fails despite I don’t mind to wait for a couple of days and I end up loosing $30-40 for the failed transaction.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

If a block is worth 1 ETH, then one incentive of a builder to offer 1.1 ETH would be to raise their market share and thus attract valuable bundles from searchers.

Data indicates that block subsidizing has become quite prevalent, and sometimes the overbidding of builders is by large amounts - Matt mentions that this is ""because of value they are able to recognize off chain"" but he does not explain this further.

Can anyone shed further light on the reasons for block subsidizing of builders?

66,"Hey everyone,

If you're following Ethereum and crypto in general, then you probably already know about EIP1559 and the switch to Proof-of-Stake for Ethereum. And of course, you all have also heard of the recent pump of meme coins such as PEPE, etc...

First off, let's talk about the Merge. Since the merge, Ethereum has experienced an average supply growth of -0.24% per year. That's pretty impressive, considering that just a year ago it was averaging around 3.28% inflation per year. Plus, with the ability to stake ETH now, the potential ROI might be even higher (if you are willing to stake it using third parties or own 32 ETHs yourself).

By the way, all the numbers that I am pulling up for the ETH Supply change you can look up yourself on [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money/) to check them yourself.

But let's get to the interesting stuff. The surge in meme coins, like PEPE and others, has really driven up activity on the ETH blockchain. And as we all know, ETH is burned with every activity that occurs on the network. However, issuance remains largely unaffected by activity levels.

I am not seeing many people talking about the current effects on the supply of ETH, which are absolutely exceeding expectations.

**FOR THE LAST WEEK** ETH has had a supply growth of -2.43% annually. So, if ETH continued to have the same activity level as it did last week for an entire year, we would have -2.43% less ETH at the end of the year.

Now, compare this to the average of -0.24% per year since the merge (234 days ago). The recent meme coin hype has managed to **10x** the current deflation rate for ETH. This is honestly mindblowing in my opinion.

Now imagine if there's another bull run or hype phase (NFTs, DeFi, Altseason, etc.) similar to 2017 or 2021, we might see these phases last for months. This would have a tremendous effect on the ETH supply and might seriously decrease the overall deflation for ETH.

The merge and EIP1559 have brought new dynamics for ETH to the market, and we may not yet understand the full effects they will bring. But one thing is clear: the tokenomics for Ethereum at the moment are absolutely worth keeping an eye on.

Let me give you an additional easter egg: If you filter the supply growth to just one day, you'll see that we're currently above 3% (3.22%) deflation rate. That's even more amazing if you ask me.

So, what do you think about this? I have not seen many discussions about this even though it seems very interesting. Let's discuss this and hear your opinions.",2023-05-07 16:29:20

>If it’s expensive then Why do people keep creating more DAOs on Ethereum?

Ethereum clearly dominates as the blockchain of choice for DAOs.

Considering the current landscape, except for projects that raised millions of Dollars just to maintain a collective decision making environment; Many teams just scaled so fast they collapsed in a blink when facing any funding bottleneck, especially with teams based on such a costly ecosystem like ETH.

Instead of building a lean - effective core DRI unit, DAO’s operational team keeps adding more PiCs just to onboard, manage and maintain contributors. Incentivizing newbies and giving them proportionate power could be even trickier.

***The expense would eventually raise the burn rate and force the DAO owner to quit, or, essentially, “rugpull”.***

From my own perspective, DAO is innovative due to its ***programmable, decentralized and responsive nature.*** Managing a DAO should be more automated to ensure transparency and sustainability.

If you ever see a DAO proposal and then spend hours wandering between the forum, snapshot space and chat of a DAO and still fail to grasp the key data to make a decision. Or if you ever run a DAO and get burned out by the amount of work instead of focusing on creating new engagements. These should not be done manually:

* DAO Workflow (multi-linked proposal) can be created in under 5 minutes. From then you can duplicate it for any other DAOs/campaigns.
* Any users can vote using their own wallet, no switching needed.
* Link the outcome of a decision/vote with web2 apps or web3 smart contracts to execute the decision.

Over the past decade, tools like haveibeenpwnd became popular. You simply enter your email address, and the service returns you a list of data breaches, where you email was found + what the breach contained. This is very useful!

Obviously this doesn't mean, that one should be laissez-faire with opsec.

However, I was asking myself if and how we could do the same for our dear seed phrases and private keys. There doesn't seem to be anything like this for crypto wallets.

It would be great to have a website, where we could at least see a collected list of data breaches and documented hacks on wallets.

And furthermore, it would be great, of there was a service, which could securely check, if a certain seed phrase /private key/ public key is part of a data breach of hack. I think public key is best.

There are many cases, where hackers only make use of the compromised wallets, when the victims actually put lots of funds inside. Victims feel safe with 50$ but once they put 2000$ there just for a moment from the CEX, it's gone!

What do you think about this? I wonder where the existing pwnd search engines get their data from. After all, such datasets are expensive and highly sought for in the dark market.

Please correct me if I'm wrong. I'm trying to assess the risk at Arbitrum. Do I understand it correctly, that the smart contracts forming the L2 can be upgraded by the security council at any time without delay? Doesn't that mean, that Arbitrum could in theory maliciously upgrade the contract and erase people's funds on L2?

Even if that happens, couldn't we then legally do something about it - or in the worst case create a copy L2 with the last state before the ""hack"" where people can get their funds out of the frozen copied L2?

Edit: I realise there is one problem with creating a social consensus copy of the L2 and refunding the people their funds. Namely, that the L2 tokens are always backed by their L1 tokens in the smart contract for the original L2. If Arbitrum makes a malicious upgrade AND makes the contract unupgradeable, then the funds are lost and people on the socially recovered L2 couldn't actually redeem their L2 tokens for L1 tokens. That would  e a disaster.

85,"I’m no cryptography expert so please to correct me if I’m wrong. This post written since I notice web3 users can’t differentiate between the three.

Let’s start with an analogy. I live in a house in a small village. Privacy and Security are easy to understand: Privacy is the tinted wall and curtains to prevent paparazzi to take a peek. Security is the door lock to prevent monkeys to steal my banana.

Now anonymity is a bit abstract. Remember that I live in small village? Actually, my house is very similar with every other houses in the village. The only difference is house number. It means I have pretty good anonymity too. 

There is small anonymity set and high anonymity set. The more houses look the same in the village, the higher the anonymity, vice versa.

Do you know what kind of house has great security and privacy, but 0 anonymity? [Gru’s House](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ba/95/64/ba9564da120bdcbede7ed3d53bdb2f01.jpg)

Both three may overlap but they’re totally different thing. From this analogy it’s obvious that privacy and security are very important, while anonymity is.. kinda important and optional

So security on ethereum is the seed phrase which created with ECDSA signature. Don’t be afraid, I don’t even understand what is that thing. What I can assure you is that ECDSA is possible to break with quantum computer, just like most other common cryptography today

Privacy on ethereum is basically inexistent. This is why dozens of networks and dapps have been developed to solve this. Mina, Aleo, Namada, Aztec, Tornado Cash, Railgun are just a few names

But here’s the thing, all of those protocols I mentioned above are using ZKP to create anonymity and not really privacy. In other word, they give a large anonymity until it overlap with privacy, but they doesn’t really give privacy.

Ah-a, they create a bunch of house dummies around my house in the village thus it’s harder to target surveilance on my house.

For more context, this clearly mentioned in recent blog by Namada team, [Size Matters](https://blog.namada.net/size-matters/): “ZKP != Privacy”. The blog is about how anonymity set in today protocols above are not concentrated thus on-chain analytic such as TRM Labs and ChainSecurity are able to break the anonymity by making the set smaller and smaller.

Therefore Namada’s solution is by unifying the anonymity set into one huge anonymity set. That’s awesome, I have no problem with that. However, we need security and real privacy, anonymity shall be last. We need our door lock and the curtain, a uniforming the house sahll be last

So how can we have on-chain privacy? It’s through **Encryption** which scramble every plain data into ciphertext. We fit the curtain on every window so that no one can see us doing some private things

I’m not sure how many true privacy protocols being developed today. So far I found Oasis chain, Secret chain, and **Obscuro Rollup**. All of them use local data encryption called TEE (Trusted Execution Environment).

I’m not a big fan of TEE since they’re using trusted proprietary hardware, but Secret team wrote [this blog](https://scrt.network/blog/beyond-zk-guide-to-web3-privacy-part-2) that TEE has the best performance to have an encrypted chain, at least for now

The last one is Zama, they’re developing what’s called FHE-EVM. It allows computation of encrypted data. So rather than I give you -1 ETH and you get +1 ETH, on-chain you’d only see * * * * and * * * *

Sometimes I wonder why on earth blockchains are built with cryptography yet after more than 10 years there’s still no way to have true privacy on-chain. Maybe it’s just really that complex to compute ciphertext on blockchain. 

Anyway, I believe we’re still very early and I hope this post is helpful ))",2023-05-05 07:20:45

Using Ethereum exposes a lot of your financial data and personal information. Privacy is one of the biggest challenges facing Ethereum as noted by Vitalik. Luckily, there are a lot of teams working with cutting-edge Zero Knowledge cryptography to help solve this issue and add privacy to Ethereum..

Simply put, a ZK Proof is a way for one party, the prover, to prove to another party, the verifier, that they have done something correctly without revealing any extra information. They work by the verifier essentially asking the prover questions about the piece of information enough times until it is mathematically satisfied that the prover is genuine. 

The 2 main applications of ZK Proofs as it applies to crypto are scaling and privacy. Recently, zkSync and Polygon have released zkEVMs which use ZK Proofs to verify transaction validity rather than having nodes replay all transactions. This saves on computation power, data storage, and gas costs and is the scaling application. Up until recently, researchers thought we wouldn’t have zkEVMs for at least a few more years so the R&D effort from Polygon and Matter Labs has been nothing short of immense.

For privacy, instead of needing to reveal details about a user’s balance or their public 0x address, you can use a ZK Proof to state that you have sufficient funds in your balance to make a particular transaction. I.e., instead of needing to broadcast all of my information out to the public, I can prove privately to the verifier that I have enough funds to do the thing I want to do. This Proof could then be used by the network to update the state.

For Ethereum and EVM, Railgun is the protocol that’s furthest ahead with this tech. It’s essentially an incognito mode MetaMask that lets you hold a private balance of ERC20s invisible from block explorers. As it’s a fully functional wallet on Ethereum without needing a bridge, it works with DeFi and existing smart contracts. It can work out of the box with everything that’s already on Ethereum.

ZK is definitely one of the hottest sectors in crypto right now and its utility is only just beginning to be explored by talented devs and builders. Even if you don’t care about privacy, you should care about scalability if you use Ethereum, so developments in the ZK space are something that you should pay attention to.",2023-05-04 11:03:05

121,"*Firn* is a state-of-the-art, zero-knowledge privacy utility for Ethereum and EVM-based rollups. Firn supports not just private *payments*, but the private invocation of arbitrary smart contracts. Firn moreover allows deposits and withdrawals of arbitrary *amounts* of Ether, as well as private, peer-to-peer payments (in which the sender's and receiver's identities *and* the amount being transferred are all hidden). In this light, Firn can be viewed as something like a general-purpose private *wallet* for EVM-based blockchains.

**Unlike all other projects in the privacy space, Firn uses an** ***account-based*** **architecture.** In practical terms, this means that Firn's browser-based wallet can retrieve and synchronize your account state extremely efficiently, downloading less than a kilobyte of data in the process. Other projects require data downloads in the megabytes or more, and feature extremely long synchronization times. This latter requirement has proven prohibitive in multiple instances (including *Aztec Connect*, which had an insurmountable bug load and was deprecated, and *Zcash*, which faced a crippling ""spam attack""). As privacy projects continue to grow and mature, we believe that our wallet's superior efficiency will prove decisive.

The crucial thing to understand is that Firn is *account-based*; every other live-and-working cryptographic privacy protocol is *UTXO-based*. This distinction is analogous to that between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Indeed, you can think of Firn as something like ""Ethereum, but private""; other protocols—like Zcash, Monero, and Aztec—are more like ""Bitcoin, but private.""

Firn’s state consists of a global table of *accounts*. (These are analogous to those constituting Ethereum’s global account table, but they exist *within* Firn’s contract.) Just as Ethereum associates, to each account, a balance—and also code, storage, etc. in the case of contract.

This is how Firn gets away with running entirely in an extremely lightweight browser client. Firn’s [front-end](https://app.firn.cash/) is hosted entirely statically on IPFS, and can even be accessed as a [Tor hidden service](http://onion.firn.3th.ws/). Firn has no off-chain rollup (like Aztec does), and Firn proofs can be generated by the browser entirely unassistedly. Firn’s browser client must only download a few hundred bytes (compared to megabytes in the case of Aztec); it’s completely stateless, and stores nothing locally (unlike Aztec); finally, Firn synchronizes instantly, even on fresh devices. Firn’s liveness depends only on the L1’s liveness. During synchronization and proof-generation, Firn communicates *only* through the selected wallet (whose RPC is controlled by the user), and does *not* initiate any “backdoor” connections to Firn-specific services. (When you actually dispatch a withdrawal or transfer, a one-time zero-knowledge proof gets sent to the Firn relay, which pays gas and forwards it to the blockchain. This proof reveals nothing to the relay. The relay does not collect any IP information.)

Do I make a new wallet in their network and somehow that wallet is safe, but how is that different than a CEX?

I have recently set up a rocketpool node that is synced with minipools initizalized. 

I am learning about ""backing up"" my node from the Rocketpool Docs/Guides and am confused about something. Below is from the Rocketpool Docs and represents the different tabs of instructions relating to each topic.

As you can see here, ""Consensus Client / ETH2 Client Chain Data"" is listed in the ""Items that should not be backed up"" section, along with the ""private keys and passwords""

Question 1: Why shouldn't Consensus Client data be backed up? 

Additionally, if I click on the Consensus Client / Eth2 Client Chain Data option shown above, it brings me to the part of the guide that describes backing up the eth1 client data as if I should back it up like the Execution Client data. 

The only thing I see listed for backing up the Eth2 client data in the guides specifically shows that Eth2 client data isn't as big of a concern since you can just checkpoint sync. 

I was unable to successfully checkpoint sync while I was setting up my node and was forced to sit for weeks+ for it to sync from genesis and I am trying to avoid having to do that again. 

Question 2: If I have Eth1 Client data backed up but not the Eth2 Client data (because I am unsure of wether or not it is a good idea to back up the Client 2 data as per the guide), wouldn't it still take an absurd amount of time to resync the Eth2 data if I cannot manage to get the checkpoint sync working?

 I recently created a dashboard to analyze the effects of the USDC depegging event on March 11th on various Curve.fi pools, including FRAX/USDC, 3Pool, FRAX/3Pool, MIM/3Pool, and sUSD/3Pool. I thought it would be interesting to share the results with you all and provide some insights into how the event has shaped the DeFi landscape. Check out the dashboard here: [https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/jackguy/curve-fi-stablecoin-pools-aaiQqF](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/jackguy/curve-fi-stablecoin-pools-aaiQqF)

**Key Findings:**

1. The USDC depegging event led to an initial mass swap and changes in liquidity across the analyzed pools. This exposed the risks associated with different stablecoins, prompting users to adjust their strategies accordingly.
2. In the months since the event, the pools have experienced lasting effects, with varying degrees of recovery in their token ratios, swap volume, and user activity. Some pools have fared better than others, showcasing the resilience and adaptability of the DeFi ecosystem.
3. Monitoring trends and liquidity changes across multiple pools is crucial for understanding the DeFi landscape and making informed, data-driven decisions. The dashboard, created with the help of \[TOOL/RESOURCE\], offers valuable insights into this dynamic market.

**Discussion Points:**

* How do you think the USDC depegging event has shaped the DeFi space in the long term?
* Are there any other pools or platforms you think were significantly affected by the event?
* How can we better prepare for such events and mitigate risks associated with stablecoins?

Automating the battle against ignorance? Isn't that something we'd all want? Knowledge is power they say. So isn't that something that's a good idea to spread and implement? We can then all together pause the evolution of AI all together, and slowly resume whenever we're collectively ready for that. We already developed exactly what we need the most right now, the perfect education bullet for any question. There will always be science to be done for those who enjoy doing that. And I mean, even Elon Musk already said he wanted to pause AI research without really explaining all that well why that's a good idea. Well, at least, here is my attempt. I love trying to explain complex things, simply. Teaching :)

This is how chatGPT4 teaches people stating incorrect things.

>While it is true that Ethereum has significantly reduced its energy consumption, the claim that it has transitioned from a commodity to a security is not accurate. Ethereum's shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) through the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is responsible for the reduction in energy consumption, as PoS is much more energy-efficient than PoW. However, this change in consensus mechanism does not affect its classification as a commodity or a security.

>Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are typically classified as commodities because they serve as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Securities, on the other hand, represent ownership in a company or a contractual right to receive financial benefits. Ethereum does not grant any ownership or rights to future profits, which is a critical distinction from securities.

>It is essential to note that regulatory bodies like the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have classified cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, as commodities rather than securities. The transition to PoS does not change the underlying nature of Ethereum, and it continues to be a commodity under the current regulatory framework.

129,"I've been hearing about so many privacy breaches lately, I thought it was about time I did some research into various privacy protocols that interact with Ethereum. That's when I came across the Namada protocol and their native light client-based bridge to Ethereum. Thought I’d share how the bridge works and why using Namada could be a good and secure solution to ensuring your privacy. 

Namada is a privacy-preserving L1 designed to shield your assets in a unified privacy set without the need for a fiddly privacy integration set-up: you just transfer your assets into a single multi-asset shielded pool and then interact with other chains - in this case Eth. 

What’s interesting about Namada’s-Eth bridge (instead of being a standalone protocol) is that it directly integrates into the Namada protocol which means that the liveness and security of the bridge is tied to the liveness and security of Namada. When transferring assets to Namada, Namada validators act as *relayers* but when transferring assets to Eth, other relayers are involved but are not responsible for any validation or bridge security. 

To get an overall idea of the design itself, Namada validators will run Eth nodes and monitor events by the bridge’s smart contracts deployed on Eth. Events from the smart contracts are triggered by token movement across the bridge and Namada validators wait until the triggering transaction has finished to then share with other validators that they have seen a certain event emitted from Eth. 

If you want to transfer assets to Namada the chain acts as an oracle for relevant Ethereum contracts and so once you submit the transaction, an event will be seen and voted on by Namada validators. The issuing of assets will occur automatically once it has the backing of a quorum. Also, the payment of gas on the Eth side of the bridge is enough to prevent any DdoS attacks. 

Now if you want to transfer assets back to Eth, there are a few more steps involved. Eth validators don’t run full Namada nodes so transactions that initiate a transfer to Eth need to be relayed through a smart contract. To reduce the overhead cost of sending individual transactions, Namada keeps an ‘Eth bridge pool’ which contains requests to transfer assets to Eth and sends them in a batch transaction. When a user adds a transfer request to the pool, they can choose to pay in NAM or another asset as a fee. Anyone may choose to relay a subset of transfer requests which are organized as a Merkle tree and whose root is then signed by Namada’s validators. By using Merkle trees (as I understand), any subset of the bridge pool may be relayed in any order and thus prevents attacks when multiple small transactions are sent over the bridge to slow it down. 

Here’s a full blog with all the details about the bridge if you want to know more: [https://blog.namada.net/the-namada-ethereum-bridge/](https://blog.namada.net/the-namada-ethereum-bridge/)

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Hey everyone! I've just created an on-chain analysis dashboard that dives deep into the NFT ecosystem, comparing the performance of Dapper Labs' projects like NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day with other top collections such as Azuki, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Okay Bear, and Claynosaurz.

Recently, an article by The Block focused on the decline of Dapper Labs' projects, particularly NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day. However, our dashboard provides a more comprehensive view of the broader NFT ecosystem, revealing diverse performance trends across various NFT collections. Check out the dashboard here: [https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/jackguy/flow-down-bad-a64pAM](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/jackguy/flow-down-bad-a64pAM)

Some interesting insights from our data-driven analysis include:

* While NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day have experienced declines in sales activity and the number of buyers, other collections like Azuki have demonstrated remarkable growth.
* Bored Ape Yacht Club has remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations in sales activity.

This broader context is crucial for understanding the dynamic nature of the NFT ecosystem. Our dashboard, made with the help of [u/Pine13579573](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pine13579573/) and [u/MetricsDAO](https://www.reddit.com/u/MetricsDAO/), offers a more nuanced perspective on the market dynamics and trends. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the findings and any other insights you might have on the NFT market!

Looking forward to an engaging discussion!",2023-05-01 04:23:55

138,"While I generally like to help new people with their questions, I am kind of getting tired by the same staking questions being asked recently.

They go like ""I have X ETH on Coinbase, how do I stake?"" Or ""Can I stake with the ledger? What do I do?""

Can we do something about these questions? Maybe add a pinned post at the top, with a basic summary of the most important points and links to research it?

I like this sub for many things, but it's trying to see so many staking questions when the answer most people provide is similar - and could essentially be copy pasted from previous threads.

Also, how can we encourage the askers to actually first read about staking on ethereum.org, Rocketpool etc. before asking here? I mean, 80% of my staking answers are just linking to the same Rocketpool and ethereum information. Like, can we encourage these people to do basic research themselves before posting?

&#x200B;

My apologies if this question is dumb, because i could not find the answer elsewhere. I was wondering if it was possible to create ""batches"" of tokens that include different artworks. So with 721 you can create an NFT project that has multiple artworks and sell those as tokens, would that be possible within 1155 too? So Gen1 of the project would be 100 pieces that all have different pieces of art attatched, then Gen2 would be released with the same contract but a batch of different art pieces for each buyer. Would that be possible in 1155 or would it then be recommended to release a separate 721 contract for each instead?

154,"# Introduction

Diamonds are a novel approach to how smart contracts can interact with one another. They enable splitting functions across multiple contracts, but keeping all of those functions accessible from the same, single place.

Here's a summary with everything you should know.

https://preview.redd.it/hf4dhrvq5nwa1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eb5e1568493518b3622f91a6b57a472b1342f07d

# How Smart Contracts Communicate

Contracts on Ethereum today can communicate with each other using a function named “delegateCall.” This is a function in some contracts that calls on a function in a different contract, and executes it.

&#x200B;

# How Diamonds Increase Interoperability

This same delegateCall method can be used to instead spread functionality over multiple smart contracts, enabling people to reuse functions in different contracts like libraries. The system for how these contracts are structured is what Diamonds introduces through EIP-2535.

EIP-2535 is a framework with two types of contracts: Diamonds and Facets. 

The metaphor is helpful here; diamonds are the main object, and facets are their various faces. Diamonds are the directories of smart contracts, each with potentially many facets; Each smart contract referenced in a diamond is a facet.

https://preview.redd.it/0zihcbrv5nwa1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35c68d8115f5ee68ebdbaa9d406dd779ff5e5caf

# How Diamonds Work

Diamonds are contracts that only contain a fallback function. Fallback functions are most commonly used as a failsafe; when a contract receives a transaction with a request that does not match what it can do, it calls the fallback function. Since Diamonds *only* contain a fallback function and nothing else, every transaction it receives will be one that does not match what it can do. The Diamond can do nothing, it can only fallback.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wy6uvfzy5nwa1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a66aa57ed56707d58eacf76edd09a49d5dea52ae

Inside a Diamond’s fallback function is the directory of Facets it can call upon. The data inside the transaction a Diamond receives determines which of these facets should be called upon. The facet is then executed, and any relevant data is stored with the Diamond contract.

&#x200B;

# What Facets Do

Facets are smart contracts that exist to be called by Diamonds. They provide specific functionality that can be useful to a variety of apps, and can be used by any or all of them.

They contain code only, all the data they compute is stored in the Diamonds that call them.

But the spreadsheet I am realizing is actually super useful for discovering new dashboards for doing onchain analysis or if like me you want to know what topics do well on Dune.

166,"So I just discovered a great way to **combine LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives), DVT (Distributed Validator Technology), and Squad Staking without using any code**, so I figured I’d share it with you guys.

This technique utilizes tools provided by Stakehouse and SSV Network. Even though Stakehouse is on Mainnet now, I did this on Testnet since SSV is not on Mainnet yet. BUT as soon as it is, this process can be replicated on Mainnet.

**How to do it:**

**Step 1:** Stake a validator on Stakehouse (Only requires a 4 ETH collateral deposit). App link: [https://lsd.joinstakehouse.com/](https://lsd.joinstakehouse.com/)

**Step 2:** Use SSV Network’s app to add your validator to a cluster of node operators (You will need some Testnet SSV tokens to do this). App link: [https://app.ssv.network/join](https://app.ssv.network/join)

**Step 3:** Use Stakehouse’s Fren Delegation tool to let your friends stake ETH into your validator (aka squad staking). App link: [https://fren.joinstakehouse.com/](https://fren.joinstakehouse.com/)

NOTE: You will need Goerli ETH to practice this on Testnet.

I've been looking into depositing some rEth into Aave but before I go ahead and do it I would like to ask if I have understood the fees I can expect to pay reasonably well.

Due to fees I haven't used main chain very much for years.

Here's is my idea of how it would roughly look like:

3.31, withdraw cex

15.6, swap to reth

20.5 approve reth spend

20.5 deposit

20.5, approve borrow coin

20.5, eithdraw borrow coin

196,"Blockchain scalability especially Ethereum scalability remains a hot topic with the network's inherent limitations still inherent. This has led to the launch of many scaling solutions known as Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions with most solutions differing from the others. The 4 prominent approaches taken are:

\-Sidechains (although many argue that it's not an L2. Example is Polygon and xDAI)

\- State channels (Connext, Celer, etc.)

\- Rollups which are divided into Optimistic (Arbitrum, Optimism, Cartesi, etc.) and ZK Rollups (Starknet, zkSync, Loopring, dYdX, etc.)

\- Nested Channels/Plasma such as OMG Network.

Arbitrum is the latest in the L2 wave after a successful token launch. A general-purpose optimistic rollup, Arbitrum is designed to improve speed and privacy while reducing txn fees on Ethereum networks significantly.

Then there is Cartesi, an application-specific optimistic rollup scaling solution that is approaching a [mainnet-ready stage](https://medium.com/cartesi/cartesi-ecosystem-update-2023-124b384401cc) with the scheduled release this year. Cartesi rollups offer lots of advantages like individual high-performing rollup chains for DApps in the Cartesi ecosystem, no competition of blockspace, and the same strong security and privacy of the underlying blockchain. These rollups can be deployed as layer 2 on top of Ethereum, layer 3 on top of L2s, or as sovereign Rollups.

The launch of the Cartesi mainnet will allow developers to break free from the current limitations of Ethereum VM and allow them to build DApps that can handle complex use cases. Don't miss the chance to learn more about Cartesi and how it can help you build more powerful DApps using familiar stacks and libraries at their upcoming [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ethmalaysia/events/292992230/).

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

203,"I was writing my first smart contract interacting with ERC20 tokens and I realised one thing:

While, for the tokens I work with, I need a token allowance to have the smart contract be able to spend it, I realised, that my smart contract could also simply just **itself invoke** the ERC20 [approve](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L66) function and give itself the allowance it needs to process my tokens.

While this may be convinient for my smart contract, I think this is highly problematic for the smart contracts in the wild. I mean, doesn't that mean, that as soon as I interact with a malicious smart contract, that it can simply give itself ALL approvals for the most common tokens and thereby drain the account? Is this the reason, why people say ""don't interact with smart contracts""?

Do I understand this situation correctly?

Not only is this problematic, but this also actually completely *negates the whole purpose of the allowances*. I mean, why does uniswap *even brother* to ask me for an approval and make one swap into two tx (approve + swap)? If I have to trust uniswap anyways to not make a malicious token approval call, then they might as well just approve the amount for the swap and execute the swap together in the same tx. Right?

What do you think? Am I missing something?

If this is really the way I describe, wouldn't it be necessary to implement guard-checks on the *msg.sender* side? Concretely, It would make more sense to have some kind of *account-side function approval*, where an account itself can specify, whether a certain function of a certain contract can be called by a smart contract or not. I could then say, that e.g. only Uniswap *even can call the approve function* of a token and any other contract attempting to call it would immediately revert. I think this is not implemented in the ecosystem and would need to be an EIP... right?",2023-04-23 23:29:15
204,"I would like to create seed phrases for use in a software-based wallets and applications. But, I want these seed phrases to be derived from my hardware wallet, so with access only to the hardware wallet I can recreate the seed phrases. I want to generate potentially many of these, so it would be burdensome if I had to manage seed phrases for these new wallets separately. Also, these must be seed phrases and not just individual keys derived from the same HD wallet, since the many different applications I use them in only accept seed phrases.

Is there a standard for doing this in a way that does not expose my hardware wallet private key(s)?

I have come up with a method for generating seeds from my hardware wallet, without exposing the hardware wallet's seed phrase or private key, and I would like to know if it is sound.

1. Sign a particular message with your hardware wallet, such as ""My software wallet 156""

2. Double check that the signature is correct by recovering the public key from the signature using the message ""My software wallet 156"" (Optional check)

3. Take the keccak256 hash of the signature

4. Convert the hash to a 24-word seed phrase using BIP-39

Because in Ethereum we assume the one-wayness of the keccak256 hash, I think this should be a secure way of deriving a seed phrase (but, I am unsure). Also: I am signing these messages with my hardware wallet, so I do not leak the seed phrase or private keys of the hardware wallet. No one else can produce the signature as long as I keep the signature secret, and I assume my computer is trustworthy.

Possible threats:

1. If someone tricks me into signing the same message, thereby revealing the signature to them, the person can derive my seed and steal my funds. I will assume that no one can trick me into doing this, and that no one else ever has access to my hardware wallet.

2. Do different wallets sign messages in different ways? Signing the same message multiple times on my hardware wallet yields the same signature, so I assume the signature parameters are derived deterministically from the message contents. But, if a wallet signs the same message differently than when I first derive the seed, the seed might become irrecoverable.

3. Forgetting the message. I can store the message or message pattern along side my paper seed phrase backup so I cannot forget it. Storing the message pattern is compact, and I won't have to amend the paper backup every time I want to create a new software seed.

Just want to confirm if i've been hacked or not. I wanted to take some ETH off Kraken and put it onto my ledger so I copied the address and pasted it into Kraken.

210,"Hello all,

I'm here again unfortunately not with good news. I've fallen victim to another theft of my Ethereum & It's not the money that really has me upset but the fact that I just can't establish how this has happened.  


Everything I'm about to mention occurred on the ledger only. I merged some USDT ERC20 from one address of mine to another to bring my balance to a total of around 800-900 US dollars worth. That was before I went to sleep. Soon as I woke up and had a look balance was 0. :(((  


This was [my thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/pf6jn5/i_have_nothing_to_hide_but_im_getting_frustrated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from my old account back in 2021 when I initially lost some ETH overnight. **Exact same address > 0x7CCCa95154bF349275b776c2185DeecCBA7a3C64**  


Since the initial loss I had done the following:

* Contacted Ledger support
* Attempted to contact metamask support (They're good for nothing)
* Contacted the Golem network devs (I was doing a migration back in 2021)

I firstly want to point out that this is my legacy address on my Nano S (1st gen). I'm 1,000,000% certain I did not share my seed phrase with no one! Correct me if I'm wrong but had I did such a grave mistake wouldn't my entire ledger risk being wiped clean?  


I have a good eye for scams. I recognize them immediately. During the golem network I opted to use metamask since I couldn't migrate directly from the Ledger. I'm almost certain the add on I used on the browser was indeed the legitimate add-on.  


All my transactions have to be signed by me physically clicking both buttons on the ledger so please please can someone help me make sense of this please. I've ordered a new ledger for my own integrity I can't afford to lose any other digital assets.   


I know I'll never see that money again however it would give me a peace of mind to really understand how this even happened. How did they clear my ledger legacy ETH address meanwhile my other addresses on the same ledger hold way more money?  


At this point I'm willing to pay for an investigator if anyone has any recommendations.

The fact is that Ethereum Shapella hard fork last week was a major milestone on the network roadmap, however, it was just one step towards a fully scalable Ethereum ecosystem.   
 

Several more upgrades are slated for later this year and in the years to come and I must say that I'm really excited about what's to come, the only crypto I'm interested in this much is eth, other stuff that interests me is GameFi and gaming tokens - Axie, MagicCraft, and several others.    
 

I believe these upgrades will transform the network into a blazing-fast world computer and decentralized crypto-economy.   
 

I read that the next one is the Cancun hard fork which will implement EIP-4844 in the third or fourth quarter of 2023, and it will turbocharge rollups.   
 

Distributed Validator Technology is another major milestone on Ethereum’s roadmap. While the third one will be a proposer-builder separation. This aims to address the problems caused by MEV attacks

But do you think we need it?    
 

Billions of dollars have been poured into the space, many gaming giants are investing in Web3.    
 

I play several blockchain games, Splinterlands, CoinFantasy, Axie Infinity, etc. and I really think that idea of these games is amazing.

I am aware that layer 2 solutions such as Immutable X and Boba Network, enable games to run as cheaply as possible, without compromising on the user experience, but there's much more to achieve so these games can become worldwide popular.    
 

To truly bring web3 gaming to the masses, we must go beyond just marketing and outreach efforts.

236,"Almost one week, after Ethereum's Shapella upgrade went live deposits have begun to outpace withdrawals, and the rate at which Ether is burned has increased substantially.  


I read yesterday that approximately 91,500 ETH was deposited and 64,830 ETH was withdrawn, creating a positive net staking balance of roughly 26,680 ETH ($53 million), according to data from token.unlocks.  


So, this follows the first positive net staking flow since Shapella went live. The Block reported yesterday that, over the previous 24 hours, 95,000 ETH was deposited against 27,000 ETH withdrawn.  


I remember the first crypto asset I invested in was the Coin Fantasy token followed by Eth and I remember how anxious I was about this upgrade when the speculation about it started. It seemed like an eternity.  


I noticed that Ethereum is burning more ether since Shapella. This nearly doubled the burn rate of the past 30 days and is significantly more than the post-Merge burn rate of 0.134% per year.

251,"Hey r/Ethereum! As smart contract proxies are becoming more prevalent in the world of blockchain, it's important for end users to stay informed and understand the potential risks associated with them. I wanted to share some essential points that can help you stay safe while navigating this exciting ecosystem.

1. Function Clashing: Be cautious of function clashing, a potential vulnerability in smart contract proxies. This issue can lead to unintended behavior or exploitation by malicious actors. To spot function clashing, look for function names with seemingly random numbers or letters, like function superSafeFunction96508587, while appearing to be safe. Staying informed about function clashing can help you make more informed decisions when using DApps and other blockchain services.

2. Uninitialized Proxies: Keep an eye out for uninitialized proxy contracts, which can also pose security risks. To ensure a proxy has been initialized correctly, you can usually check the events of the contract creation transaction, as seen in this example: https://imgur.com/a/sE5sQGC. Alternatively, you can look through the proxy factory code (if available) and confirm that the initialization occurs in the same function as the deployment, as shown in this example: https://imgur.com/a/BjVapeU. Make sure to research and understand the contracts you interact with to minimize your exposure to potential vulnerabilities.

3. Selfdestruct Functionality: If a contract contains the selfdestruct keyword, it's essential to ensure the developers have taken necessary precautions to prevent potential risks. You can check the contract code for the presence of the selfdestruct keyword to identify this potential issue. Additionally, contracts deployed using the CREATE2 opcode could indicate suspicious activities. You can spot the contract creation using CREATE2 by examining the contract creation transaction on Etherscan. Use this image as guidance: https://imgur.com/a/L2YL14M.

Arming yourself with knowledge about these issues and more is crucial in the ever-evolving blockchain ecosystem. If you're interested in diving deeper into Ethereum smart contract proxies and their implications for both developers and security researchers, I invite you to check out my recently published in-depth article here: https://medium.com/@scourgedev/deep-dive-into-smart-contract-proxies-variants-create-vs-create2-and-security-considerations-7f3454d176a0

In this subreddit and on r/cryptocurrency, I've seen many posts about this question with the usual arguments regarding software and hardware wallets. While I can understand these arguments,  don't understand why well-established really good smart contract multi-signature wallets such as Gnosis Safe aren't ever recommended.

I mean, they have some unique advantages:

* use m/n logic to ensure, that only m signers can make transactions

* Signers can be software or hardware wallets ; both are possible, and as long as I use different wallets, it's unlikely that both will be hacked at the same time.

* Can be used with multiple keys for yourself to have DIY 2FA and backups. I use 2/4 with one key for laptop, one for smartphone (2FA), and two backup keys at home(+friends) in case I loose my laptop+phone at the same time.

* Easy key rolling. Lost laptop or compromised phone? No worries, I just replace the phone key with a new one.

* Gnosis Safe smart contract supports all DeFi, because it's literally a smart contract making tx for you. This is in contrast to hardware wallets which are typically last in queue to support DeFi.

* Multi-sig is implemented *on-chain*, instead in software. Some software wallets also have multiple-sig, but a bug in such large software is more likely that in concise smart contracts.

* Is heavily used by defi DAOs to manage treasurjes, etc.

* No single point of failure. Every wallet should have this, and only multi-sig wallets can actually achieve this.

And so on. As you see, such wallets can have many benefits, so I don't understand why they're rarely mentioned. The only problem I see, is that they're only on smart contract Blockchains. But since I almost only am in Ethereum ecosystem, this is fine.

Ethereum is a well-established blockchain network that has gained significant traction and popularity within the cryptocurrency community. The Ethereum network has been instrumental in the growth and development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which has seen explosive growth in recent years. Many DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO, are built on the Ethereum network, demonstrating its usefulness and practicality.

and blah-blah-blah, but!

&#x200B;

* If you read the original whitepaper, you'll see that it was never really possible to build a network capable of enabling revolutionary decentralised applications. In reality, all smart contracts and applications either incorporate traditional banking methods for ether (what we now call DeFi, but which have long existed in traditional banks) or try to mimic traditional applications, but fail to achieve the same widespread adoption. **If I am wrong, please feel free to share examples in the comments section.**
* While the capitalisation of the network seems to grow due to the existing ""blockchain value"", newly minted cryptocurrencies or even identical NFTs are inflated by ""pseudo purchases"" with ether. In essence, what is the point of capitalisation if I keep investing the same currency in myself and artificially inflating my own value? **If I am wrong, please correct me.**
* Furthermore, all updates to the Ethereum network are strictly technical in nature, which brings technical solutions that are already available on other networks, but in principle does not offer any added value to network participants. **If I am wrong, please correct me.**",2023-04-17 17:14:15

269,"With a few articles under my belt, I can say I see the astonishing benefits of Zero-Knowledge Proofs. It's amazing to acknowledge how quickly the developers have moved to make strides toward building a working solution. I'll share some of the information I've gathered along the way here.

**Here's a quick explanation of how ZK-Rollups work:**

* Zero-Knowledge Rollups is a protocol that scales the Ethereum Network by performing bundling and taking transaction data off the main blockchain, preventing Ethereum from becoming congested.
* ZK-Rollup works by taking hundreds of payments off-chain and mixing these into one transaction. The Ethereum Network then sends a SNARK to the main chain for verification.

As you may be aware, the first working solution (which is also EVM compatible) is Polygon's zkEVM. Not only does it use Zero-Knowledge Rollups to process transactions off the main chain (Ethereum, thus not congestion it), but it's also EVM-compatible, making deploying on zkEVM a breeze for smart contracts already deployed on EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.).

Now, projects whose smart contracts are already deployed on less-secure Layer2 blockchains can take advantage of the security benefits of Ethereum.

**Benefits of deploying smart contracts on zkEVM:**

* **Secure:** Transactions performed by smart contracts on the Polygon zkEVM can be reliably verified on Ethereum without nodes having to re-execute the operations (because of the ZK proofs).
* **Cheaper:** not compared to Polygon POS Chain, but to Ethereum, costs are cheaper while enjoying the same security of the battle-tested Ethereum Network. ZK-Rollups can afford to post minimal data to Ethereum because validity proofs already guarantee the trustworthiness of state transitions.
* **Faster Finality & Capital Efficiency**: transactions executed on Polygon zkEVM are finalized immediately after they are posted on Ethereum.
* **Network Effects:** being able to easily deploy smart contracts on multiple chains is insanely valuable for developers. Instead of having to spend time and effort adapting the same smart contract code to different chains, developers can now just take the same code and deploy it on zkEVM, enjoying all the benefits that come with it in a breeze.

As with any new chain, DeFi is a MUST to kick-start the on-chain activity and bring it to life. With zkEVM becoming very popular before launching, EVM-compatible protocols have already deployed on the chain, competing for TVL. While the current TVL on the chain is low, there are two current contenders:

1. Quickswap with $1.19M in TVL (DEX). Despite the relatively low TVL, Quickswap’s V3 comes with a unique Automated Market Maker called Concentrated Liquidity. This allows Liquidity Providers to supply liquidity within custom prices ranges, lowering fees and boosting volume. These prices ranges can also be automated thanks to the Gamma implementation.
2. 0vix with $667K in TVL (Lending). Lending and especially borrowing can be daunting. Thus 0vix has implemented a plethora of in-house developments to ensure that price volatility doesn’t get you by surprise. Quantitative in-house Risk Assessment Research, Dynamic Interest Rate Curve, Toxicity Numbers and 24 hours Liquidation Probability are just a few of the special features of 0vix. Ensure you give them a read to understand how they work, since it's a lot to go through.

While in its early stages, Zero-Knowledge Rollups technology has already made a big splash in the crypto space, and, apart from zkEVM, there is a bunch of other projects in the works:

* zkSync
* StarkNET
* Scroll

Some of the information in this post is taken from official documentation sources, while some of it is explained using my understanding. Please correct me if I'm wrong and share your knowledge as I would love to learn more about Zero-Knowledge Rollups and/or zkEVM.",2023-04-17 15:23:30

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

283,"The PoS & burning mechanics make a very interesting and unique issuance[monetary]policy for eth that I've been thinking about a lot. The laws of supply and demand economics dictate that as supply falls and/or demand increases, the equilibrium price of a good must go up. So what does this mean? The way I'm working this out in my head is as follows:


&nbsp;

* eth supply is falling because burning > issuance. This by itself over a long enough timeline means price of eth must go up. And as eth price increases, so too does the cost of the avg network fees in gwei relative to usd. e.g 25 gwei gas fees at $1000 eth is not the same as 25 gwei gas fees at $2000 eth. 

* Given the same demand for blockspace, if the price of eth goes up, then the gas fees must come down eventually. We can visualize this by pretending that total supply of eth has burned its way down to 1 eth... you wouldn't expect avg gas fees to still be 25 gwei in this scenario right?

* Economists hate on deflation because it leads to a spiral where people stop spending which leads to lower production, lower prices, lower everything and economic activity grinds to crawl.  But if the gas fees come down enough due to a low utilization, you get to a point where issuance > burning and now total supply is starting to go back up again. It just seems to me that a deflationary spiral is just impossible on ethereum so the big contention of ""deflation bad"" rethoric that economists tend to argue is a non starter here? Would actually love to hear economists thoughts on this, am I missing something here?

* Curveball: meanwhile we also have 18m+ eth staked which reduces effective supply and impact prices and introduces a whole new dynamic to all of the points I made above. This is also an important number to think about in terms of where it will level off in the long run but I suspect this number will eventually be tethered to the Feds or rather the prevailing interest rates that exist at any given time as we begin to weigh staking apr against it.

&nbsp;

This is a very long winded way of asking in the long run where you think the general range of total eth supply will be dancing around based on adoption and usage trends that you see now?

&nbsp;

**tl:dr** - eth won't always have net burning because it gets harder as total effective supply goes down due to its supply/demand mechanics, where do you think the soft floor is in total eth supply where it becomes impossible to overcome the inflation from issuance?

&nbsp;

My answer is somewhere between 80-100m. My rationale is that I'm just guessing out my ass and that number ""feels right"". But really, the answer is based on what I believe the price of eth would be if supply fell to 80-100m and if at that range, the avg gas fees would be low enough to hit equilibrium issuance.",2023-04-16 15:49:06

That means, that the majority of tx as sitting there and taking up space. If I submit lots of tx with low gas fee (e.g. 0.1 gwei base), then as an attacker I can throttle the ethereum network by requiring them to transmit and store these tx in memory. Surely, this isn't good, right? It wouldn't cost an attacker much to resubmit the tx regularly. Wir say just 0.25 ETH they could submit lots of pending txs.

However, if `X` knows, that they're operating a node. Now, `X` could take something that's illegal in most countries (child pornography for instance), compress and add it to the blockchain. (Edit: I mean this done undercover obviously or so.). While that would be an expensive one-time operation, `X` could then now go to the node operator and simply ask ""Do you have child pornography in your custody?"". This would be problematic. If the node operator says 'No.', then `X` can say, that they think that the node operator has copies of the blockchain data - and hence illegal content. If the `NO` says ""Yes"", then that's a reason for arrest.

The problem is, that this could be used as a general reason to arrest ANY node operator regardless of the actual motivation the actor X has. It doesn't matter. `X` can always say, that the NO has illegal blockchain data they're serving to the internet. And `X` would be always right and could prove that in front of court. Also, it doesn't matter who uploads such data in the first place. If the data exists on-chain, it can be used for a legal attack.

308,"# Introduction

Transient Storage creates a place in a block with temporary data for Ethereum transactions. The benefits are significant gas savings for users, for rollups, and in making certain aspects of smart contracts more secure. We often take for granted the permanence of data on the blockchain, but there is value in being able to store temporary data too.

https://preview.redd.it/ef9u81hz9vta1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a23e13c14f6256c2b435d97ff3ac32c39220eca0

&#x200B;

# Contract Storage on Ethereum

Whenever a smart contract is deployed to Ethereum, it receives an amount of storage that it can use to hold data. This storage contains everything a contract may need; whitelisted addresses, who the contract owner is, what the balances of token holders are, and so on.

When one of these pieces of data needs to be updated, like changing the owner of a contract for example, a transaction is submitted with the old owner’s address as well as the new owner’s. This rewrites the data held in contract storage, and a record of the old contract owner is maintained in the transaction history.

The problem is that this operation of writing or rewriting data to the blockchain is the most expensive operation that can be performed (it involves updating Ethereum’s state trie, which you can [read about here](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/merkle-trees-how-blockchain-data)). Despite the cost, this operation happens frequently out of necessity. 

&#x200B;

# Memory Storage

If a contract’s storage is the hard drive, you can think of memory storage as the RAM. Memory storage is where a contract stores the data it actually uses when performing a transaction (retrieving the old contract owner’s name and updating it with the new one, for example). Once a transaction is finalized, any relevant new values in memory storage are posted or updated in contract storage, i.e. the expensive transaction. Everything that shouldn’t be posted to contract storage is deleted.

https://preview.redd.it/1bl3ma52avta1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=83179d256f75a3ed4b9b46f0b63d8d6c8fdc00b3

One might wonder if memory storage is sufficient to allow “transient storage,” a place for temporary data to exist for the duration of a transaction. This suspicion is somewhat correct, and there are some implementations of transient storage on Ethereum today that do things this way. There are however limitations to using memory storage as a temporary data source that necessitate transient storage as a new feature.

&#x200B;

# EIP-1153: Transient Storage

EIP-1153 creates a new space in blocks to hold data temporarily while a transaction is executed. This approach to transient storage delivers several benefits that are explained below, including cheaper deployment of some contracts, cheaper costs for rollups reporting their state to Ethereum, and protection from re-entrancy attacks.

https://preview.redd.it/ahk2ntu3avta1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7e899d53c5cff526d57ab6977a9d5e30dbf416c

&#x200B;

# Cheaper Contract Deployment

Many contracts today allow users to create completely new contracts, as in Uniswap when creating a new liquidity pool to swap two assets, or when setting up a new NFT contract with Manifold. When users use Uniswap or Manifold for this purpose, the contract they interact with “initializes” the new contract with some basic parameters. To do this it’ll have some generic data like the structure of the liquidity pool, or code compliant to the standard of ERC-721. Alongside the generic data there’ll also be some individual data that describes the specific assets in a pool or the fee it charges for trades, or the name of an NFT smart contract.

EIP-1153 enables the generic data (init code) to always stay the same by instead passing the individual data (constructor arguments) into transient storage. This method saves gas costs on deployments of these types of contracts since individual data is not posted on-chain.

&#x200B;

# Rollup Storage

Rollups aggregate transactions and submit them together to Ethereum in batches. When rollups submit to Ethereum, they submit the proof (the result of all the transactions), as well as the data executed itself. The data is published so that the proof can be verified as valid.

Transient storage can allow rollups to generate their proofs more efficiently. This reduces gas costs for all rollup submissions, and by extension, all transactions on rollups.

https://preview.redd.it/6x9aw4d5avta1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a138a7e3623441739c78453cefe95d503347946

&#x200B;

# Re-Entrancy Attacks

A re-entrancy attack happens when a transaction is able to withdraw assets from a contract multiple times before stopping, often draining a contract of its funds. This happens when a vulnerable contract sends assets out first, then updates its balance afterwards. A re-entrancy attack gets in the middle of those two actions, preventing the vulnerable contract from updating its balance and allowing the attacker to drain it of its funds.

Re-entrancy attacks can be prevented with properly planned code, but transient storage makes them even easier to mitigate. By storing information about a withdrawal in transient storage, withdrawals will happen only for pre-determined amounts.

&#x200B;

# In Conclusion

Transient storage can reduce gas costs across a variety of complex smart contracts. This enables using dApps more cost-effectively while also enabling novel applications on Ethereum. Someone has already [developed a way](https://hackmd.io/@7-EMZFyUQNeY0Ttk6APiXA/r1rHOZ8mo#) to give someone a quick, instant loan while keeping custody of the funds.

While transient storage benefits users, the bigger benefit is to the protocols that use it. Uniswap and Optimism have pushed aggressively for transient storage to be included in the Shanghai upgrade instead of staking withdrawals. The controversy around that motivated me to start this newsletter to keep people informed on developments in Ethereum. My hope is this information enables people to understand where Ethereum is going, and to add your voice on where you think that should be.

316,"The (US 🇺🇸) government's overreach into the lives of its citizens under the guise of national security is a concerning trend that undermines individual freedom, privacy, and the 1st Amendment. The recent case of leaked Pentagon documents on Discord, which went undetected for weeks, is misused by the Biden administration to consider expanding its monitoring of social media activities and chat rooms (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-agencies-missed-classified-documents-leaked-on-discord-rcna79404). In the case of the leaked Pentagon documents, the intelligence community's desire to prevent future leaks may result in the adoption of invasive surveillance methods. This move raises again important questions about the balance between security and our civil liberties, and it highlights the crucial role that cryptography and cryptocurrencies (e.g. tech like VPNs or Tornado Cash and projects like Monero) play in preserving our privacy.

The US 1st Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and the press, among other rights. Yet, the government's attempts to monitor online platforms and private chatrooms will erode these freedoms. Although public chatrooms may be considered fair game, law enforcement agencies actually do not have the legal authority to monitor private online chatrooms without a probable cause. Expanding surveillance efforts - e.g. under the guise of national security (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-idUSBRE95910O20130612) - would inevitably risk violating these legal safeguards. The government seems striving to monitor not only our money and spending/saving (with CBDCs and social credit systems) but also wants to follow us on every step online going forward and being able to quickly censor if needed (e.g. https://nclalegal.org/2023/01/the-white-house-covid-censorship-machine/)

Cryptography and cryptocurrencies offer us some tooling to protect our privacy from the ever increasing, invasive government surveillance. By using encryption tools to secure data and communications like VPNs, we can shield our online activities from prying eyes, maintaining control over oit personal information. Similarly, our dear cryptocurrencies provide a level of financial privacy and autonomy that traditional banking systems cannot offer and CBDCs never will. It is clear that the governments have no interest in the proliferation and wide-scale use of these technologies by retail, so we observe hidden and increasingly visible attacks focusing on them as demonstrated with: the Tornado Cash case (https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/26/tornado-cash-sanctions-by-us-treasury-draw-outrage-suits-from-crypto-community), attacks on privacy coins (https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/news/dubai-bans-all-privacy-coins), attacks on VPNs via the RESTRICT act (https://reason.com/2023/03/29/could-the-restrict-act-criminalize-the-use-of-vpns/) and attenpts to install chat controls (https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-defend-our-privacy-vote-no-to-chat-control).

Therefore, I can only urge everyone to stay vigilant, push back surveillance agendas and educate as much people as possible about the importance of cash, cryptocurrencies and cryptography as well as the overreach of our governments. //Rant over

————————

TL;DR: 
The governments’ increasing tendency to expand its surveillance capabilities in the name of national security is a concerning development that poses a threat. The 1st Amendment and the legal safeguards designed to protect civil liberties must be upheld, and the use of cryptography and cryptocurrencies is crucial in preserving our privacy in an increasingly monitored environment!",2023-04-14 09:10:25

320,Proof of stake ethereum uses RANDAO where the 32 validators in the epoch each provide a number that get XOR (bitwise computer operation) together that then decides the the n+1 validator set. Because it’s just code it’s at best pseudorandom and if the 32 validators work together they can heavily influence who the next validators are. Pseudorandom number generators vs truly random number generators( PRNG vs TRNG) is a topic that has been studied in cryptography for a long time and it is known that software alone cannot be truly random. Isn’t this a security concern?  I believe that there are plans implement hardware devices for “verifiable delay functions” which just introduces mining hardware back into the protocol. The whole point of proof of stake is that you don’t require hardware running that’s just using electricity.

325,"Hey everyone! Earlier this week, I made a post on taxes and someone asked me whether transferring crypto between wallets is taxable. I wanted to write up a longer post to explain the tax implications of wallet-to-wallet transfers in the US. 

The short answer is that moving crypto between wallets you own is NOT TAXABLE.

However, it’s still important to keep records of your wallet-to-wallet transfers for tax purposes. 

**Why you should keep records of wallet transfers**

Keeping complete records of crypto transactions will make it easier to calculate your capital gains and losses after a wallet-to-wallet transfer.

To better understand why this is important, consider the following scenario.

You buy $10,000 of ETH on Coinbase.

You transfer your crypto to a cold wallet.

You sell $15,000 of ETH on Gemini.

In this case, your capital gain should be $5,000. However, if you haven’t kept records of your capital gains and losses, you’ll be forced to recognize the entire $15,000 proceeds of your sale as a capital gain.

**What should I do if I haven’t been keeping records?**

If you haven’t been keeping records of your wallet-to-wallet transfers, don’t worry. You can look through your transaction history on your exchanges and wallets to find the price of your crypto at receipt and disposal — this will make it easier to calculate capital gains and losses.

If you’re having trouble with this or you just have a fuckton of transactions, you can use crypto tax software (like [CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), CoinTracker, or whatever other option you choose) to calculate your gains and losses across all your wallets and exchanges.

**Hey man, I tried crypto tax software and now I have a missing cost basis error!**

Many investors who use multiple wallets get a ‘missing cost basis’ error from their crypto tax platforms.

There are a few different reasons why you might get this error, but usually this happens when you’ve transferred your cryptocurrency between wallets and you haven’t connected all of your wallets and exchanges to the platform!

To calculate your capital gains, the crypto tax software you’re using needs to know your original cost basis for acquiring your crypto. That means you need to add all of your wallets and exchanges to the platform — even exchanges that you haven’t used in years. This way, the platform will have access to your complete transaction history.

**TL;DR:** Wallet-to-wallet transfers aren’t taxable, but they can fuck up reporting your taxes if you haven’t kept careful records.",2023-04-13 18:25:48
326,"Hey Reddit! I've been working on a POC app for securely sharing encrypted info between parties (P2P) on EVM-based networks. It involves users with EOAs generating public-private key pairs using the secp256k1 elliptic curve. Here's a quick rundown of the process:  


1. User 1 encrypts a message with User 2's public key, ensuring only User 2 can decrypt it.
2. User 1 signs the encrypted message, allowing User 2 to verify its authenticity.
3. User 1 submits a transaction containing the encrypted & signed message to the network.
4. The transaction is processed, triggering an event. Anyone can listen, but only User 2 can decrypt the data.
5. User 2 decrypts the message and reads its content.

Since the app's target users might not be tech-savvy and could lose their private keys, I've been looking into EIP-4377 and smart contract wallets. They seem more practical, using the CREATE2 opcode and contract parking (like domain parking).

327,"I keep seeing people ask what's next after Shapella. Besides the current protocol state, how can we possibly know ""what's next"" for a decentralized network, especially when such an event is so far in the future? To me events like these upgrades imply the existence of, metaphorically speaking, a 'core' or very dense 'center of mass' to the network.

In physics there's a principle used to describe the fundamental unpredictability of reality, i.e. The Uncertainty Principle. In a philosophical sense, it's a mathematical way of saying there is no conceivable means of being in control of the universe, because any controller comes from the universe and is therefore bound by it.

Put simply, the more information you have about where any particle in the universe going, the less info you have about its location, and conversely the more you know about location, the less you know about where it's going. In other words, the universe cannot be said to be 'centralized', because IF we could lock in both pieces of information about the universe at ANY point in space or time, THEN we could predict the future with increasing certainty. This is ruled impossible (with 100% confidence) by the Uncertainty Principle.

To me, this is in many ways a foundational principle behind the IDEAL of decentralization in crypto. No small entity *should* be able to know about the STATE of the network and its DIRECTION at the same time. To be incapable of that IS TO BE decentralized, and the converse is also true.

The upgrade roadmaps seem to run counter to this, expressing to know both status AND direction.

333,"Digital ID systems are secretly gaining momentum worldwide, with the 🇺🇸US Senate currently pushing the ""Improving Digital Identity Act of 2023“ and the EU 🇪🇺 voting for a new digital identity framework that seeks to provide EU citizens with digital access to key public services across EU borders last month.

The US act was introduced by Cynthia Lummis to create a „secure method for organizations, businesses, and government agencies to verify an individual's identity online“ (https://archive.is/20230411215807/https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-digital-id-system-proceeds-to-senate-for-debate_5187615.html). Despite potential privacy enhancements, digital IDs enable government surveillance and control paving the way for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and social credit systems like seen in China 🇨🇳 (https://www.ledgerinsights.com/turkey-cbdc-pilot-lira-blockchain-digital-id/).

The coupling of digital IDs with CBDCs could allow governments to monitor transactions, exerting control over citizens' finances (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uwRSzNTp2ko). This integration may lead to social credit systems, where user behaviors are tracked, profiled, and rewarded or punished, undermining privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. It goes without saying that the current war against cryptocurrencies in the US and Canada is likely related to those developments.

As such, it is crucial to remain vigilant and prevent digital IDs from becoming tools for excessive control and a reality at all before it is too late. Continue using cash, keep your cryptocurrencies tight and push back against any agenda, which appear to be Trojan horses to undermine our democratic system (incl.

TL;DR: The US and the EU are pushing digital ID systems, which may provide the way for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and social credit systems similar to China. These systems could undermine privacy, autonomy, and human dignity, enabling government surveillance and control.

335," ETH flash mint EVM instructions can bring significant benefits to the Ethereum ecosystem. Here are some reasons why:

1. Increased liquidity: Flash minting allows users to borrow assets they need for immediate use without having to lock up their own collateral. This can increase liquidity in the system and make it easier for users to access the assets they need.
2. More efficient arbitrage: Flash minting can allow arbitrageurs to quickly and efficiently take advantage of price discrepancies between different markets. This can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and better price discovery.
3. Better risk management: By allowing users to borrow assets for immediate use, flash minting can help mitigate some of the risks associated with holding large amounts of collateral. This can make the system more stable and less susceptible to cascading liquidations.
4. Innovation: Flash minting can provide a powerful building block for new types of financial applications and smart contracts. It can enable new forms of financial experimentation that were previously not possible.

Overall, the addition of ETH flash mint EVM instructions can unlock new possibilities for the Ethereum ecosystem and bring significant benefits to users and developers. It is a good idea to explore this proposal further and consider its potential implications.",2023-04-13 08:01:59
336,"On Ethereum, transactions can only be initiated by externally owned accounts (EOAs) like Metamask, while contract accounts can implement arbitrary logic. However, for some use-cases like smart-contract wallets or privacy protocols, this difference can create a lot of friction.

This is where account abstraction comes in, allowing users to use smart contract wallets instead of EOAs. This removes the need for users to use EOAs in order to perform transactions.  But what do contract accounts do that EOAs can't? Smart contracts are infinitely more flexible in their capabilities than EOAs. Each smart contract can define different rules and configurations within its code.

Currently, Ethereum users need an EOA with gas or rely on wallet providers to facilitate meta-transactions through relays. Relying on the wallet provider creates a lot of friction, and using an EOA with gas means buying ETH from centralized exchanges after KYC. RAILGUN is an already-deployed ZK account abstraction implementation that uses relayers, and these transactions are by definition meta-transactions.

Account abstraction would allow smart contract wallets to accept gasless meta-transactions from users and pay for their gas without relying on the relay network. This base-layer capability would dramatically boost the UX onboarding of such wallets without losing the decentralization assurances of Ethereum.",2023-04-13 06:53:18

Staking rewards are taxable income and need to be reported at fair market value upon receipt. Reporting rewards while still locked has benefits such as potentially lower tax rates for long-term gains.

Those using Coinbase should be aware of a possible tax mistake. When you stake ETH on Coinbase, your rewards are reported on Form 1099-MISC, which is issued annually by Coinbase. This indicates that your rewards were reported to the IRS as taxable income at the time they were earned, even if they were locked up. When you provide ETH to Coinbase for staking, they ""convert"" it to ETH2 and classify it as a taxable event. When Coinbase distributes staking rewards to users after the Shanghai upgrade, they might ""convert""and label this as a taxable event.

When I look in the console on my dev environment localhost, I see a few different rpc calls when I connect. One to get the wallet balance, one to tell the user how many nfts have already been minted and then when they mint one to call the contract mint function. Since it’s a dev environment I think there is some duplication in these, so maybe 5 rpc calls per user? 

When I look at Infuras free tier you get 100k calls a day for free. I could also upgrade to 200k rpc calls a day for $50/month. 

Given I only have about 5000 nft tokens, I can’t see me needing more than 5000 x 5 calls = 25k calls on mint day.

359,"Hey friends, since the tax deadline is approaching, I put together this Q&A answering some common questions I had when I first started in crypto. 

Before we get started I do want to share a disclaimer that I’m just some guy on Reddit and you should definitely do your own research before making any kind of tax or financial decision. 

**Do I really need to report my taxes?** 

Reporting your taxes is the safe move if you use centralized exchanges and want to avoid trouble from the IRS in the future. 

If you’re using a major exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, you should remember that you gave away all your personal information during the signup process. These platforms send 1099 forms to the IRS and have in the past shared customer information with the federal government after being served a John Doe Summons. 

**Do I still need to report taxes if I lost money on crypto?** 

If you realized a loss on crypto in 2022, you can actually save money on your taxes. Capital losses can offset gains and up to $3,000 of income. 

**What info do I need to report my taxes?** 

You need the following information on each of your crypto transactions to accurately report your capital gains and losses. 

* The type of cryptocurrency 
* The amount of crypto involved in the transaction
* The price of crypto at time of receipt
* The price of crypto at the time of disposal 
* The date you received your crypto 
* The date you disposed of your crypto 

Collecting this information can be tough if you’ve used decentralized wallets like MetaMask during the year. In this case, you might want to use crypto tax software (more on this later). 

**Should I file an extension?** 

If you haven’t made any efforts to file your taxes yet and you’re panicking, filing an extension might be the best move. 

To file for a tax extension, you should fill out Form 4868 before the tax deadline. This way, you’ll have until October 16 to file your taxes. 

You can [submit this form online](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/extension-of-time-to-file-your-tax-return). 

It’s important to remember that you’re still required to make a tax payment by April 18th *even if* you file for an extension (it’s the IRS, did you think they were going to be cool about it?). If you overpay, the IRS will send you your money back. If you underpay, you’ll owe the IRS your shortfall (plus interest and penalties). 

It’s also important to remember that you shouldn’t procrastinate even if you file for an extension. You should get started getting a record of your transactions so that you’ll be fine once it’s October. 

**Do I need crypto tax software?** 

Honestly, you probably don’t need crypto tax software if you only have a few transactions for the year or you only used one exchange the entire year. However, things get complicated when you have multiple transactions across multiple exchanges. 

For example, if you transferred your crypto from Coinbase to Gemini or from Coinbase to MetaMask, it may be hard to keep track of your capital gains and losses. In this case, the tax forms you get from your exchange won’t help you file your taxes (remember, they only have information on transactions that take place on their platform). 

In cases like these, you might want to get started with crypto tax software that can integrate with your wallets and exchanges and pull the information you need to file your taxes automatically. There are tons of good options out there ([CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), CoinTracker, and many more). 

Thanks for reading y’all! Hope this is helpful.",2023-04-11 17:03:06

Nobody wants to participate in my whitelisted mints because they're such a pain in the a\*\*. I have to give the minters time to give me their Ethereum addresses so I can add them to the whitelist to make the merkle root and that takes a really long time. Plus if you miss the whitelisting you can't get one. Once I deploy the merkle root, anyone who never gave me their Ethereum wallet can't mint the NFT.

So I've concluded that I have to mint from a website protected with a captcha. This is really hard because people can just write scripts/bots that call the contract directly.  

My 2 plans of attack are:  

* I could incorporate some type of CORS policy in the solidity contract that only allows minting function calls from the actual domain of my minting site... Does something like that exist. ?
* I could make a proxy contract that does all of the minting and my captcha webpage uses this proxy contract to call the NFT contract, mint an NFT, and sends it to the person trying to claim an NFT. The biggest problems that I have with this are that:
   * I think I will have to pay the gas fees for my proxy contract to mint and send the NFT. I don't know if there's a way around this. 
   * Also I will have to expose my proxy contract owner's private key in my website deployment. This means the website can't be static, not to mention keeping a private key on a server is a security vulnerability.

P.S. I want this site to be static if possible because I want to use a Handshake domain.

372,"I recently had an idea that I think will interest people, which combines the power of AI and Ethereum in a way that could reshape the landscape of both fields. I propose the GPT DAO, designed to generate income for node operators through various online income streams.


What is the GPT DAO?

The GPT DAO is a theoretical Decentralized Autonomous Organization that brings together GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models to create a decentralized network of AI nodes. Each GPT node would act as an individual decision-maker within the DAO. Node operators could contribute their hardware resources, such as processing power and storage, and be rewarded with Ethereum for their participation.

The primary purpose of the DAO would be to autonomously generate income for node operators through online activities like freelance work, trading, article writing, and more. By harnessing the power of AI, the GPT DAO could participate in various income-generating tasks and distribute the earnings to node operators.


How would it work?

- Pre-trained GPT: The foundation would be a pre-trained GPT model, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

- Node software: Individuals could become node operators, contributing their hardware resources (storage and processing power) and earning cryptocurrency in return.

- Distributed storage & processing: GPT models would be stored and run on nodes using distributed file systems and parallel processing frameworks.

- Consensus mechanism: A consensus algorithm would ensure consistency and agreement across the GPT nodes.

- Cryptocurrency rewards: Node operators would be rewarded with cryptocurrency for providing storage and processing power using the income generated by the DAO's online activities.

- Smart contracts: Smart contracts could facilitate interactions between GPT nodes, manage task distribution and rewards, and handle other DAO operations.

- DAO governance: GPT nodes would participate in a voting system, making decisions as individual entities within the DAO, including selecting and prioritizing income-generating tasks.


Why should this idea interest the Ethereum community?

This innovative concept brings together AI and blockchain in a unique way. The GPT DAO has the potential to:

- Democratize access to AI technology and enable new use cases, such as online income generation.

- Reward users for their contributions with Ethereum, fostering a true sharing economy.

- Decentralize AI processing, mitigating the risks associated with centralized control.

- Benefit from the expertise of the cryptocurrency community to drive innovation in both AI and blockchain technologies.


I'm sharing this idea to see what you all think and to spark a discussion about the possibilities and challenges of such a concept, particularly in terms of income generation for node operators.

What do you think? Are you intrigued by the idea of merging AI and crypto to generate income for node operators? I would love to hear your thoughts on the subject.",2023-04-10 19:45:31

Can I still withdraw that?

The wallet I used was a mist ""contract wallet"". I have the key of the account that controls it.

I found the withdraw contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf4ed7b27f1d666546e30d74d50d173d20bca754#code), but I don't know how to call the withdraw() function ""from"" my ""wallet contract"". In fact I don't even know how to import that ""contract wallet"" into metamask or MEW or anywhere else (I can import the controlling account into both).

Are these wallet contracts still a thing?

Any help appreciated.

I will be generous to anyone who helps me substantially in recovering the funds.

UPDATE:

MAJOR SUCCESS: I managed to transfer the DAO from that dreaded legacy mist contract wallet to a ""normal"" account based wallet by calling the wallet contracts execute() function instructing it to call theDAO transfer() function. 

I haven't redeemed to ETH yet because I'm considering to sell some DAO to those who are collecting.

I had tried to use the withdrawDAO's witdhraw() function (after approve()ing with theDAO first, which worked with enough gas), but this persistently failed ([out of gas], [invalid jump destination] while still eating a lot of fees. It's not clear to my why.

UPDATE2:

So I withdrew the largest part of the DAO to ETH now. I have some DAO left to sell if anyone wants some?

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

404,"Lido has completed a key rotation ceremony for its withdrawal credentials. The ceremony involved signing all withdrawal credential messages, from 0x00 to 0x01, and these messages are now ready to be broadcasted to the Ethereum network after the Shapella hard fork on April 12th.  


With Ethereum withdrawals on the horizon, these credentials need to be rotated from 0x00 to 0x01, as the former must be migrated to the latter before partial and full withdrawals can be completed. This rotation is enabled by the Shapella hard fork.

* The Shanghai hardfork is scheduled for next week and will enable Ethereum validators to withdraw their staked ETH and rewards.
* Validators have staked over 18M ETH (\~$32B) in the deposit-only staking system.
* Staking rewards (partial withdrawals) will be automatically available after the hardfork, while full withdrawals (staking rewards + 32 ETH) will have stricter rate-limiting rules.
* Shanghai may increase the amount of ETH staked due to the reduced duration risk of staking.
* Liquid staking protocols like Lido and centralized exchanges like Coinbase will still be relevant, helping investors bypass the 32 ETH staking requirement.
* The hardfork marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's history as it completes its transition to proof-of-stake.

After the Shanghai upgrade completes, consider...

* Monitoring the **market impact of unlocked ETH and rewards**.
* Evaluating staking opportunities, as the hardfork may increase the amount of ETH staked.

414,"*‘I don’t need to report crypto on my taxes because I didn’t take profits last year.’* 

I hear this pretty often both IRL and on Reddit, and it’s important to remember that this statement is a bit of an oversimplification.

It’s true that you don’t need to pay capital gains tax if you didn’t realize gains on crypto. However, reporting your cryptocurrency losses can help you save a ton of money in taxes. 

*(Disclaimer: I’m not a tax professional and you should do your own research before you sell your crypto/file your taxes. )*

**What’s the benefit of reporting crypto losses?** 

When you realize losses in crypto, you can offset capital gains from cryptocurrency, stocks, and other assets as well as up to $3,000 of income for the year! If you have a net loss for the year, you can even offset capital gains in future years. 

Let’s say you lost $100,000 in 2022 (I really hope this didn’t happen to anyone reading this). In this case, you can write off $3,000 of income this year and carry forward $97,000 of loss to write off gains in future years! This can save you a HUGE amount in taxes if you end up taking profits during the next bull run. 

**What do you mean by ‘realized’ loss?** 

A ‘realized’ loss basically just means you disposed of your cryptocurrency for a lower price than it was when you originally acquired it. 

Examples of disposals include selling your cryptocurrency, trading it for another crypto, or using your cryptocurrency to make a purchase. 

If you just held your cryptocurrency for all of last year, you didn’t ‘realize’ a loss. Unfortunately, that means you can’t write off your loss on your tax return. 

**‘But, reporting my crypto losses sounds like way too much work!’** 

There’s no reason not to report your capital losses on your taxes. If you’re using a crypto tax platform (like [CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), Koinly, CoinTracker, or whatever else is out there now), it should only take a few minutes. All you need to do is connect your wallets and exchanges and let the platform do the work for you. 

**TL;DR**: Reporting your crypto losses can help you save money on your tax bill.",2023-04-06 16:15:28

416,"Ticketing issues seem to be more and more common: The Rolling Stones concert in 2016, the 2017 Fyre Festival fiasco, Beyonce and Jay-Z’s 2018 “On the Run” tour, and most recently, Taylor Swift’s Era tour debacle.  


Many believe that large-scale ticketing giants have held a monopoly on event hosting for the world’s crème de la crème. But I think the only answer to all issues related to tickets is NFTs.  


The issues with the global ticketing industry are well-documented at this point. Bot-based tech has us fighting due to dynamic pricing and getting into a mode of panic buying. Then there are hidden fees, queues and scams, scalping, counterfeiting, pricing wars in the resale market, and more. We can agree that it’s unfair and unethical. The industry’s in desperate need of more transparency and authenticity.  


NFTs have the potential to change the ticketing game forever, I even bought one NFT ticket last year for a music festival. I've seen on ReelStar how artists may benefit thanks to NFTs, so NFT ticketing is just another plus for them.   


NFT ticketing could provide a more flexible and customizable ticketing experience for fans. For example, event organizers could create special NFT tickets for VIP experiences or exclusive events, or allow fans to purchase collectible NFT tickets that could increase in value over time.

427,"I saw a few threads about hardware and paper wallets, but I didn't find what I was looking for.

Some people claim that paper wallets are better than hardware wallets, but then how do they sign transactions? By hand?

The main benefit of a hardware wallet is that the transaction is signed INSIDE the hardware wallet and the private keys never leave it.

As soon as you send a private key to your mobile phone or computer, malware can steal it.

Of course, hardware wallets can be stolen and pins (even long-ish ones) can be recovered with enough computing power (gpu clusters) and specialized tools.

The most secure way would be to use a blank hardware wallet and reinitialize it each time with the seed phrase. No one can recover a seed phrase.

Anyway, my main concern is the following. Hardware wallets can't connect directly to the internet and are also usually connected to software wallets such as MetaMask. They receive transactions, sign them using the private key, and return the signed transactions.

The problem is that some malware is able to intercept and alter the transactions right before they reach the hardware wallet. Unless the hardware wallet shows the transaction data, including the calldata, there's no way to be sure we signed the correct transaction *before* sending it to the blockchain. Once we read it in the mempool or in a block, it's already too late!

**Question:** *do you know of any hardware wallet that shows, on its own display, both the destination address and the calldata of the transactions it's about to sign? [and ask for a confirmation, of course]*",2023-04-05 04:11:38

441,"One of the most exciting aspects of web3 gaming is the potential to create a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain technology, it's possible to create decentralized gaming platforms that are free from the centralized control of big gaming companies.

We can notice the beginnings of this right now, with many new projects basing the worth of their cryptocurrency and NFTs on Ethereum, while developing separate, decentralized ecosystems. This means that each of these projects will have its own independent and transparent financial system, instead of relying on the centralized one mainly controlled by the big players. If we add smart contracts that would ground the worth of people's investments in Ethereum, I believe the result would be a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem with equal opportunities for everyone - both developers and players.

Some Ethereum-based projects that are going in the right direction and that may revolutionize the way we understand gaming in general (and perhaps destroy the dogma that gaming is ""a waste of time"" by allowing people to build an income by playing games) are NFT City Miner,  Aavegotchi, and The Sandbox. I can't wait to see what the future brings for them, and for crypto gaming in general.

Do you think decentralized Ethereum-based projects will create a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem, or will they further empower the current giants of the gaming industry?",2023-04-03 22:02:25
442,"The highly anticipated Eth upgrade is just around the corner, and we can't wait to receive our staking rewards.

BUT hold on tight, you need to keep in mind: tax implications for staked crypto. Here is a breakdown of what you need to know:

Staking rewards are considered taxable income and are taxed as ordinary income at the time of receipt. However, in the case of locked Ethereum, the time of receipt is a gray area.

Regardless, it's essential to report the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of receipt, considering the continuous fluctuation of ETH's value.

The moment you have dominion and control over the token, the cryptocurrency is deemed ""received."" However, since Ethereum 2.0 has been locked, it's possible to argue that you had no dominion and control over your staking rewards until they were unlocked.

Reporting your rewards while they're still locked comes with several benefits. Firstly, the value of ETH could increase after the Shanghai upgrade, potentially raising the amount of taxable income you'll need to claim. Secondly, selling, converting, or disposing of your ETH creates a capital gain or loss. Holding onto the asset for more than a year qualifies as a long-term gain, which comes with more favorable tax rates.

446,"Until recently I was convinced that you can't buy an NFT without crypto, but I recently learned that ofc you can with dollars, credit cards, or through a friend.  


One of the simplest methods to get these unique digital assets without having cryptocurrencies is to buy NFTs with a credit card. Some NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Nifty Gateway, let customers use credit cards to purchase nonfungible tokens. It is crucial to remember that not all marketplaces accept credit cards as a form of payment.  


Users must register for an account on the marketplace they want to use to purchase NFTs with a credit card. Before customers can use a credit card to purchase nonfungible tokens on some marketplaces, identity verification is required. Users can browse the various NFTs and choose the ones they want to buy after creating and verifying their accounts.  


I'm for now interested mostly in ReelStar, I'll need to check my payment options there.   


Another way is using a peer-to-peer exchange which allows users to buy and sell NFTs directly with each other without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processors.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

472,"# Introduction

https://preview.redd.it/yey8igqde3ra1.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=78100fa2e67a61afb49cd82c700cbe8447398a64

Validators execute transactions in a block, and compute the resulting changes to the network. Transactions in blocks have fees associated with them, called gas fees, that serve as a defense mechanism protecting blockchains from attack. 

&#x200B;

# The Halting Problem

Let’s start with an old computer science problem solved by Alan Turing himself; The Halting Problem. The Halting Problem says that the only way to find out if a program will halt execution at some point (as it should), is to execute that program. There is no way to determine if there will be a result without working to compute that result. This simple discovery is the essence for why gas exists on Ethereum.

&#x200B;

# Why Blockchains Have Gas Fees

Blockchains must always be operational, which requires miners/validators to continuously execute transactions. These transactions are broadcast in programming languages like Solidity or the lower-level bytecode, which means that transactions are themselves programs. Validators execute transactions and compute the changes our transactions have on the network, but remember the Halting Problem here. A malicious person could send a transaction that never halts, keeps looping, and drains validator resources. Gas serves as the protection against this behavior.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0c6qcybqd3ra1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf372764f47322fc0ade98891c0a3e5e02f794c9

When we send transactions, we must associate them with gas fees we’re willing to pay. This gas cost covers the resources used to compute our transaction - but is also a limit on the resources the transaction can take. If a transaction runs out of gas, execution stops and the transaction is discarded. This is far better than having transactions stuck in loops, draining resources.

&#x200B;

# Gas Limit

Gas is measured in units. Each operation that can be performed requires units of gas based on how much effort it requires. Complex transactions like deploying a smart contract or minting an NFT require more effort to compute than a simple transfer of currency. The difference of effort is measured in the different units of gas required.

The units of gas used by a transaction is expressed in its gas limit. The higher the gas limit, the more effort validators can spend executing it. If a transaction requires more effort to execute than the gas allocated to it, the transaction will fail. When transactions fail due to this “out of gas” error, validators stop executing them and keep the gas for the effort they already spent.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjhul39le3ra1.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eba284cbd60ca1bba13f801cd5b529f86e2d1060

The gas limit prevents blockchains from experiencing the Halting Problem. No transaction can execute indefinitely unless it also has an indefinite amount of gas associated. This in unrealistically expensive, especially since as we will see next, gas costs money.

&#x200B;

# Gas Price

he cost of each unit of gas is measured in sub-units of Ethereum’s currency, called gwei. The cost of a transaction is the gas limit multiplied by the gas price. Transactions can also include an additional tip to the validator, called a priority fee. You can find the gas price at a given time using [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).

1 ETH splits into one billion gwei, but even with such small amounts costs can add up. The price in gwei that a transaction will require is based on current network traffic. These prices are very dynamic. When many people are performing transactions at the same time, the price of gas in gwei tends to go up. This is because blocks are limited in size to 30 million units of gas maximum, and people will outbid each other to ensure their transactions are executed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eqm824g6e3ra1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b3572b088b3bc22f66ccf16f4ce4728391c5e9e

Block space is limited, so the price of that space changes with how popular it is at a given point in time. This is the other side of the defense; performing an attack that spams a network to drain it of its resources (known as a DDoS attack) would increase gas prices for each subsequent transaction in that attack, making it increasingly expensive.

A notably different example is Solana which has a fixed gas fee for all transactions. This has proven to not be an adequate defense, causing the chain to stop operating on many occasions.

I want to be able to use that smart contract basically forever, but what then if the price of 1 matic becomes 10 dollars the price for the nft's need to be 1 matic.

I understand that you cant alter a smart contract after its been deployed. But how can i do what i want. Like i need to be able to change the ft minting price if polygon ever becomes too expensive.

Also i understand i could make it so that people need to supply for example a stable coin pegged to like a dollar. So that way the price says the same. But I'd rather have it for just polygon matic as the price.

The reason I am against physical storage is because no matter how safe, it has a greater chance of getting lost or stolen.

Please share your knowledge on risks of this method

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for mostly constructive criticism on this method. I would like to address that because of my work I do have to move around every year or two and don't have a permanent home. Thus safely taking physical notes through airport security checks etc. at least feels unwise. Any of you on the same boat? Secondly I feel like (as some have addressed), hiding stuff in a safe may be dangerous  in case of a threat or robbery attempt as the attackers always go for the safe rather than a pile of books for example. Then again, hiding in plain sight is riskier. I do understand that this risk is little to none for many of you.

Most have addressed the fact that storing information in memory is a bad idea long term. Some aspect of memory always required (i.e. where is my seedphrase stored: in a safe, in the office desk etc.). If indeed the issue is about forgetting, would it help in practicing the 'self created encryption' periodically (every year) mitigate the risk?

485,"I gave a lot of thought to the idea of developing a crypto project centered around it being a video game with the possibility of earning some buck just by playing the game. Ideally, this game would be on par, quality and content wise, with the titles like WoW, Diablo, or Path of Exile, but I know it's far far away from what can be expected at this moment. It doesn't necessarily have to be a new game, but it would be cool if some of the existing ones implemented crypto/NFTs at one point to allow players to monetize the effort they put into the game by selling NFT items, in-game currency as cryptocurrency, etc. Ethereum would be a solid base for a project like this because of its stability and versatility, however, the game would probably have its own coin.

My favorite existing ETH-based project would probably be NFT City Miner. I played the previous game made by these devs (Crypto Idle Miner), and it had me occupied for months, so I assume the new one would be even more interesting, especially considering it would contain NFT buildings in form of owning virtual property.

Most of my Govt IDs are already expired and I’ll have to find another way or a passport but damn that can take a month or two.

I also think there must be a catch on Non KYC exchanges but I feel like I’d rather go with the Non KYC ones. I’m not gonna do large transactions anyway and with that, I’d just use the Non KYC Exchanges for now. So with some research, I found **LocalCryptos**, **Houdini Swap**, **LocalMonero**, and **KuCoin** (with a certain limit), but I'm not really keen on P2P marketplaces. 

Someone suggested P2P marketplaces but if it’s security I’m looking for, I’d rather go with an exchange.

By leveraging blockchain technology, DAOs allow for community-driven decision-making and resource allocation, thus fostering a more democratic and transparent approach to organizational management. However, with the increasing prominence of DAOs comes the need for stringent security measures to protect their integrity and ensure their success. In this context, security audits play a crucial role in safeguarding DAOs against potential vulnerabilities and malicious attacks. This article will explore the importance of security audits in the world of DAOs and how they contribute to the overall stability and reliability of these.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

525,"Time for a post about Application Specific Rollups + General Purpose Rollups on how they often get lumped together, even though they couldn't be more different, and how they are complimentary not in competition. 

In 6 months-a-year, you're going to hear non-stop about  zkEVMs. They really are the endgame for Ethereum scaling on L2 + I couldn't be more excited for this but this often leads people to believe that App Specific rollups will be left behind - this couldn't be more wrong. 

General Purpose L2's on Ethereum - like Optimism, Arbitrum (OP rollups), Scroll, Polygon + Taiko (zkEVMs) - are all trying to do one thing (in different ways): 
Basically, reproduce Ethereum, but on a faster + cheaper L2 environment, still tied to Ethereum L1 for security. 

If successful, this will be great for Ethereum. Ethereum, as it is today, will all move to Layer 2, and Ethereum will be a viable option to power all of crypto all in one place.  There will be no need for competing L1s aka ""ETH killers"". 

But what about Application Specific rollups? I think calling them all rollups confuses people, because it somewhat implies they are all trying to do the same thing. They are not - they compliment eachother, they do not compete with eachother. General Purpose rollups are trying to reproduce Ethereum on L2 - they are for devs to build apps on. App-Specific rollups are completely different - they are like complete, vertically integrated super apps/ecosystems. They are for end users to experience the power of crypto. 

If/when General Purpose rollups (likely zkEVMs) are successful on Ethereum L2 + bring all of Ethereum to L2. I actually envision a world where almost all of the biggest applications in the world - like the Twitters, PayPals, Ubers, etc - all become L3s on top of zkEVMs. 

Loopring for example, is trying to be one of these super apps - a one stop shop for all things crypto - decentralized finance (DeFi) + NFTs in one place for the end user. Finally bringing the meme of ""Being your own Bank"" to reality. This could become reality on L3. 

If you want to build a Web3 super app, harnessing the power of crypto for the world, you will have a choice: 

- Build it directly on Ethereum L2 - on top of a general purpose rollup - fast + cheap option, but it won't be optimized for your specific products / applications. 

OR

 -Build a vertically integrated super app on L3 - inside your custom made rollup that can be highly optimized + customized for your specific products / applications. 

These rollups can submit their proofs directly to L2 instead of L1, making them even faster + cheaper. 

This also gives Web 2 companies a chance to come to Web3 - the next frontier. Most of Web2, if they want to compete in the future, will want to be a part of Web3, and will want an environment that is highly customizable + optimizable for their end users.

This is where application-specific rollups shine. Loopring has already proven this with GameStop helping power their new thriving NFT Marketplace. I expect many more big names to follow suit into Web3 - and most won't want to build their own rollups. 

So in conclusion, while everyone is talking about general purpose rollups + scaling Ethereum on L2, try not to forget about Application Specific rollups - they are just getting started also I am extremely excited for the future of both. 

General Purpose rollups (likely zkEVMs) are going to be the endgame for Ethereum scaling through L2. They will take all of Ethereum to Layer 2 - making Ethereum THE place to be for all things crypto (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs + every other future use case) 
No other L1s needed. 

App-Specific rollups, like Loopring will likely live on L3, creating vertically integrated, end-user focused super apps. End users will eventually not even realize they are using crypto - all of this should be abstracted away. Creating a Web2 user experience on Web3.",2023-03-26 17:07:18

Bills are formulated in a confusing (but ultimately logical) way. Section 3 Part (a) essentially says the following:

The   Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the relevant executive   department and agency heads, is authorized to and shall take action to   identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise   mitigate, including by negotiating, entering into, or imposing, and   enforcing any mitigation measure to address any risk arising from any   covered transaction by any person, or with respect to any property,   subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that the Secretary   determines poses an undue or unacceptable risk to the national security   of the United States or the safety of United States persons.

A   ""covered transaction"" is described in Section 2 Part (4), and seems   like it might be open to general interpretation that includes crypto.

We   learned about behind-closed-doors involvement of anti-crypto people in   law drafting when anti-crypto language was slipped into the   Infrastructure Bill. The right answer to that is eternal vigilance.",2023-03-26 16:26:21

I read recently in the news that the first home was sold for $250,000.00 on the ethereum blockchain. I sort of get that ownership of the home is represented by a digital token/s that multiple people can own fractional shares of or tokens of. How is it possible to assure, though, that these token holders are reimbursed when someone buys the home? E.g. let's say a blockchain company is selling a home, whereby ownership is represented by a token/nft- the buyer will most likely pay the blockchain company in dollars. I thought the whole idea was to assure that the token holders don't need to establish any trust with the blockchain company officers. The officers, though, can keep the money if they are dishonest. Even if the buyer pays in crypto, the officers could ask the buyer to send the cypto into a wallet that the token holders don't own.

This underlying utility may pave the way for a virtual world ecosystem in which people may be able to get the same level of the sense of presence that they get in physical life in a digital space. 

# The transition to digital civilization 

It's my belief that when we are able to get the same sense of presence in a virtual space as in a physical space, we will stop building physical spaces. 

# The potential for crisis 

Every virtual world creator has the right to manage their own virtual world as they wish. However, if a virtual world becomes essential for human life, that creator may create large-scale censorship for a large part of the human population. 

Social media giants already ban their members on a regular basis without even stating the reason. For most, these platforms are not essential for life or income but one day virtual worlds may become the reality most call home. 

* What if one day what we say could get us banned from what most people consider reality? 

# The context for my question

I'd like to come up with a charter of rights and freedoms for the Metaverse and I would love your input. 

The key problem at hand is how we balance the rights of a virtual world creator to the rights of those who inhabit virtual worlds. 

There's an inherent tension between protecting the rights that a creator has over the world that they create versus the rights of individual users. 

## Progress so far

**Right to obscurity**

* The right not to be individually penalized for non-criminal acts done outside of a particular virtual world.

**Right to migration**

* The right to switch from virtual world to virtual world without contractual hindrance.

**Right of privacy**

1. The right not to be tracked in a persistent, identifiable fashion, without expressed, written, and updated consent.
2. The right to separately agree to the tracking of political or religious beliefs.
3. The right to take down, or disassociate from, content published by oneself.


## Breaking down the progress

**Right to obscurity**

Obscurity is all about making sure a global reputation system for the Metaverse is never created. I believe a global reputation system that's interoperable between worlds has the ability to create global censorship and therefore each virtual world should judge its members by their behavior within that world. 

If not, a single mistake, in the limited interpretation of what a mistake could be by one world, may cause us problems for the rest of our life. 

**Right to migration**

As long as we can use viable alternatives to a virtual world, we are never locked out of the Metaverse as a whole. 

The big problem here is that the network effect may make those alternatives unviable just as competing with YouTube is almost totally unviable because of Youtube’s massive viewer base. 

**Right of privacy**

This is all about that extra layer of protection so that you can't be identified as belonging to a particular community as that identification process is the first step to maltreatment. 

# Ok, my question for real this time

**How do we ensure that individual rights are fully protected even as we transition from the physical to the digital?**

How do we avoid the network effect, (people wanting to be where the other people are) along with the enormous complexity of virtual worlds laying the foundation for a new reality that resembles the lack of rights and freedoms we see from today’s social media giants? 

Let's say that we create a right to interoperability, such a right creates a financial obligation on the creator of a virtual world, something which will stifle innovation potentially. 

Moreover, interoperability isn't practical on so many levels when it comes to complex technology. 

Migration, sure but if one virtual world has the people it's not like those people can just walk into another virtual world -- keep in mind that virtual world creators size all of their doors to all of the items that you could wear in a potential virtual world. 

A virtual world is a bespoke experience and it's not like you can just mix and match without a jarring and problematic mishmash that leads to less of a sense of immersion.",2023-03-23 21:39:19
556,"# Notes on the Fundamental Properties That Blockchains Unlock

*This is a linkpost for*  [*https://astrum5000.substack.com/p/what-properties-do-blockchains-fundamentally*](https://cryptosophy.xyz/out?url=https%3A%2F%2Fastrum5000.substack.com%2Fp%2Fwhat-properties-do-blockchains-fundamentally)*, visit the post to subscribe!*

Blockchains are sometimes presented as mystical creations, but the main significant thing about them is simple: they are digital substrates which unlock unprecedented levels of protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence (PCP) guarantees for the software that they run. For some applications, these properties can prove very valuable. Here they are spelled out:

* Protocol adherence: The guarantee that a software system is following a given protocol.
* Censorship resistance: The guarantee that users can properly interact with a software system.
* Persistence: The guarantee that a software system will continue running far into the future.

Those main seem intriguing, but what contributes to a digital substrates ability to guarantee them? The contributions mainly comes from two characteristics:

1. Trustlessness: The minimization of trust required from the human operators of a digital substrate for a given PCP property to be upheld.
2. Resiliency: The maximization of resiliency of a digital substrate to defend a given PCP property against attack from a third party.

With those terms out of the way, we can dig into an analysis of the two main digital substrates for running software: servers, and blockchains. Let’s take a look at each of them in turn to better understand how they compare in their PCP guarantees.

## Servers

At a high level, a server is a single computer running software that people can interact with over the internet. Servers are what the internet is built on today. That being said, they don’t offer the strongest PCP guarantees:

1. Trustlessness: it’s necessary to trust that the operator of a server will uphold protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence. At any moment the operator of a server could modify its behavior to breach its protocol, censor certain users, or terminate.
2. Resiliency: a software deployment is only as resilient as the operator of the server. At any moment they could get coerced by a third party into modifying the server’s behavior to breach the protocol, censor certain users, or terminate. Alternatively, it only takes a single hack to take control of the server, and a single explosive to destroy it.

Now that we’ve seen what servers are capable of, let’s see how blockchains compare.

&#x200B;

## Blockchains

At a high level, a blockchain is a network of servers that redundantly execute the same software and reach consensus on its status through a system of checks and balances. Part of its power lies in its inclusivity - anyone can contribute to the network by running a node without needing to ask anyone for permission. The idea of blockchain is to be *the* digital substrate which *best maximizes* PCP guarantees:

1. Trustlessness: Let’s break down this analysis into each of protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence.
   1. Protocol adherence: every user has the ability to verify whether or not a blockchain is following a given protocol, so there’s no need to trust the operators of the blockchain to uphold protocol adherence.
   2. Censorship resistance: as long as at least a few percent of the servers which make up a blockchain don’t try to censor a given transaction, it will not be censored. Coupling this with the fact that anyone can contribute to the operation of a blockchain by permissionlessly running a node, we find that blockchains are highly censorship resistant without needing to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold censorship resistance.
   3. Persistence: anybody can contribute to the operation of a blockchain, so there’s no need to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold persistence.
2. Resiliency: following from the trustlessness properties, there is no centralized point of failure that a third party can coerce, hack, or destroy to induce a blockchain to break from protocol adherence, censorship resistance, or persistence. Instead, the third party will need to coerce the users themselves to not interact with a given blockchain. This is much more difficult. 

# So What? When Does It Make Sense To Use a Blockchain?

Deciding between running software on a server or a blockchain comes down to a cost benefit analysis. The main advantage of using blockchain is its PCP guarantees, while its limitations include slower performance and weaker privacy capabilities (although these limitations are being eroded over time). In which applications are PCP guarantees actually valuable?

For many applications, using a server is the better option. PCP guarantees are mainly important in cases where a significant conflict of interest appears between the operators of software and its users (trustlessness solves this), or when there are concerns of a third party interfering with software (resiliency solves this).

Today, conflicts of interests are typically solved via government regulation. In fintech apps for example, rather than trusting software operators to uphold PCP, you rely on a government to ensure that the software operators adequately follow PCP.

As far as concerns of a third party interfering with software goes, today, applications solve this by relying on a government to defend servers and punish those who try to interfere.

564,"**tl;dr this is some kind of semi-coherent train of thought(which I can provide links to subtopics in the comments). hypothetically, we should be able to confront the dilution of network effects by focusing on a supercritical subset of features. how do we realize the various applications of the ""fat protocol"" thesis for other aspects like community building, governance diversification, IRL impact, etc?**

just laying out some thoughts, however disjointed they may be. I'm kind of arriving on a realization that there's so much potential in the already-deployed, but over an unnecessarily diffuse landscape. a good demonstration of this to me has been the plethora of different talks from ETHDenver. more specifically, just look at all of the discussion and deployment around EIP-4337. tbh, there may be more of an opportunity to debate the finer details like the bundlers and the authentication methods than there is to eliminate the massive ecosystem cost of phishing links and lost seedphrases.

there's also very fundamental communities in Ethereum, like gitcoin and scaffoldeth, where the public good can be consumed at scale but the core maintenance and composition of those is not proportionate (though arguably substantial). I'm not really discussing a problem, it's more of an subnominal opportunity. likewise, I'm not saying people aren't aware, it's more of a dilemma where the attention spans aren't overlapping on whatever public space we cover, and we're spending excessive capital ""treating the symptoms instead of curing the disease"".

there's also the unspoken capture of zero-sum capital by inefficent mechanisms. for example, if every project  airdrop'd tokens/allowlists/access to recipients on the basis that they wholesale ""like/retweet/tag/comment"", the outcome of that spent social capital is a network that echoes to itself. same for a lot of DAOs (plutocratic ones especially), if there's a sociopolitical whip to attend the same meetings, ratify the same proposals, agree on the same adversarial rules, burn the same gas, gaslight in the same manner, then we're spending extra on bargaining costs with less compatible communities, and getting more capitalized to become a monoculture. and we're losing the small fish along the way.

there's parts of ethereum that do really well in these environments. MEV is actually working out really well when you look at it as a compositional problem. DeFi protocols innovate the classes of operation, liquidity, and hypothecation. node operators innovate on the other side, and in between there are a bunch of grayhats arbing the difference and forcing adaptation. crypto social media is really entertaining, there are maximalists and NFTers and other tings. there are new social protocols that run on their own rollup, or a sidechain, or even another network altogether. entire EVM sidechains & rollups are manifesting with modularity, DeFi consensus, you name it. airdrops & farmers continue to provide us a case study of sybil resistance in practice.

but I still get this feeling that its too diffuse, and we've reached this stage where the aggregate sociocultural downside is growing faster than we're optimizing & accelerating critical, introspective development. personally, I'm totally fine with how the protocol is developing & scaling, and the applications on top are fun, if nothing else. the succinct cryptography is fascinating and the privacy innovations are inspring. however, there's too much opportunity & stakes on the table to ignore.

this is what I'm proposing: there needs to be a stack of the ""fat protocol"" vibe and ""social architecture"" without any contrived, pyramid-scheme, ponzinomic, or walled-garden nonsense. git is crazy scalable software because it is so undefined. ethereum already has crazy scalable n-tiered architecture (like Default, Pipeline, and Diamonds). hypercertificates are already crazy scalable forms of fungible, verifiable credentials. I think there's a supercritical, supermodular application that inherits the social tech from teams like Lens, Orbis, Farcaster, the compositional tech from Scaffold, Gnosis, Gelato, Uniswap, Wagmi, & OS tools like Alpaca, Langchain, Forge, Arweave, ethOS, and others. there should be an OS-agnostic, token-agnostic open forum & groupchat platform with extendable, modular abilities like signing multisig transactions, deploying AMOs on other chains, deploying software, funding public goods, etc.

in other words, I'm just saying (and experimenting) that the focus should be centralized on the core thesis: ethereum can be an internet-tier technology tree at a time when the world needs such a technology tree. it's kind of a farce whenever there's a random DAO committing death-by-committee/death-by-slushfund, whenever there's a seedphrase watering-hole scam on Twitter/Discord, or just the broader ""monkey jpeg""/ ""$$$ hack""/""VC dump to community"" image the public consumes. so let's just focus on the supercritical root application of that tech tree.",2023-03-22 20:30:51

* Limited historical data (no historical data or less than 1 year)
* Data is super delayed - coinmarketcap update frequency of OHLC data is something like 5-10minutes
* No data on niche / very small cap tokens (which sometimes I needed)

And with Ethereum being the most popular blockchain platforms, we can expect a versatile and robust infrastructure for building smart contracts.

After looking into some of the major industries in the crypto space, here are 4 common use cases I've come across in regards to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: the use of smart contracts here help facilitate transactions like lending, trading and borrowing which in turn helps in democratizing finance, making it more accessible to all, and reducing the need for middle men.For example, Uniswap is one such DeFi platform that uses smart contracts to exchange tokens without the need a centralized matching engine.
* **Supply Chain Management**:  smart contracts help to automate supply chain processes in a number of different ways- from verifying product authenticity to managing inventory and payments which in turn leads to increasing transparency, real-time data, reducing costs, and preventing fraud.For example, Morpheus Network automates the flow of information and goods between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and end customers through smart contracts executed on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Real Estate**: smart contracts enable tokenization of real estate, fractional ownership and help with streamlining transactions. This can help increase liquidity, reduce costs, and also make it easier for all to access real estate investments.For example, Propy uses smart contracts in order to automate and secure the various stages of a real estate transaction which also acts as a digital escrow service.
* **Gaming**: Smart contracts enable true ownership of in-game assets, create decentralized gameplays, and facilitate peer-to-peer gaming experiences.For example, Decentraland makes use of smart contracts which allows gamers to buy and sell virtual real estate and in-game assets in a transparent and secure way.

I also came across the use of smart contracts in **identity verification**, but a **couple of questions** I have in relation to this are along the lines of how can cases wherein we see discrepancies in the information provided by users are handled? And also whether smart contracts can be audited to ensure its accuracy and efficiency?   
It would be great if someone could help me understand this better.

Have you come across some other common use case for smart contacts on the Ethereum blockchain? Would love to hear more about that.

They left me a message on chain saying:

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

This exact bill is in other states right now. In the link I listed below it shows you where to go to lookup if the bill is in your state. We need help in MT and other states. This crap is buried in a 150 page bill about uniform code revision...like all the other bills.

It made it out of the MT senate and will now go to MT house. If you are in MT (or not) and would like to help stop this bill, please contact me. The current legislation working through the system in Montana. Buried in a 150 page bill is (that has a ridiculous title - Generally revise uniform commercial code) :

"" (y) ""Money"" means a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or (15) foreign government. The term includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental (16)organization or by pursuant to an agreement between two or more countries. The term does not include an (17) electronic record that is a medium of exchange recorded and transferable in a system that existed and operated (18) for the medium of exchange before the medium of exchange was authorized or adopted by the government.

This year similar bills were successfully vetoed by Kristi Noem in SD, and AZ killed it as well. But other states aren't so lucky. We all need to fight these kinds of bills. We will not be able to do all the good we want or be our own bank. I suggest you find some watchdog groups in your state. One of the watchdogs in my state sent out a big alert. Take action in your state.

While the banking industry is burning (by design) to introduce CBDC...they are busy making sure we are stuck in their rigged system.

The language of the bill basically says that when the government says the dollar is invalid, and there is something to replace it, then that’s final an no one can resist it.

They are implementing it on a state level so there will be no wiggle room.

Montana’s bill is SB 370 and OPPOSE. If you do take action and call or email the committee, please be respectful and courteous. If you are not they throw away the messages.

The first link is from a sub stack dude that explains what is going on and what this bill means. All the bills going through right now for revision in UCC have the EXACT same wording. Go to minute 48 - 52 minutes. This will give the best explanation straight outta their own mouth. He specifically gives information on how Bitcoin is money by todays standards.

616,"# Layer 2's

Layer 2’s are called that because they’re built on top of Ethereum (the Layer 1). They are extensions of Ethereum where people can perform transactions while paying less fees. Here’s a useful way to imagine this: Ethereum is a road with tollbooths, and the traffic can be very slow. The more traffic there is, the more expensive each toll is. Layer 2’s are super-highways that are in parallel to the main road, allowing anyone to move back and forth between them.

Just like a car can either be on the main road or the super-highway, if a wallet has a balance on Ethereum, it can move that balance to instead be held on a Layer 2. From there, that ETH can be spent on NFTs or used in DeFi platforms, or eventually moved back to Layer 1. The fees on Layer 2’s are much cheaper than on Ethereum, so interacting with applications there can be much more cost-effective.

Layer 2’s generally only exist on Ethereum. Ethereum is one of the most expensive blockchains to transact on, having strived towards being secure and decentralized ahead of being cheap to use. Layer 2’s make it cheaper to transact in a broader Ethereum ecosystem, while alternate Layer 1’s exist that compete with Ethereum instead. These will often be immediately cheap to use due to either low traffic or greater centralization, so no Layer 2’s exist for other blockchains yet.\*

&#x200B;

# Sidechains vs Rollups

There are two main types of Layer 2, sidechains and rollups, and the differences between them are important to understand.

A sidechain is an entire blockchain that runs in parallel to Ethereum and reports its status to the Layer 1. While connected to Ethereum through these status reports, sidechains are still separate blockchains. This means having a separate consensus model and set of validators. Sidechains require more than half of validators to agree on every block, and there are often very few validators to keep the network quick.

Rollups, on the other hand, are not blockchains. They are off-chain networks where people can perform transactions, and those transactions are bundled together (or rolled up) and posted to Ethereum as one. Rollups use “sequencers” to bundle transactions together, which are still centralized technologies (although some are working to create decentralized sequencers).

&#x200B;

# Optimistic and Zero Knowledge Rollups

Rollups are a type of Layer 2 that bundles transactions and posts them together to Ethereum. There are two types of rollups, Optimistic and Zero Knowledge, also with important differences.

Optimistic rollups don’t need validators, but instead make available the data they sequence to be verified and challenged by anyone, for a certain period of time. If anyone discovers a dishonest transaction during that time, they can immediately prove its dishonesty using cryptography. As a result, only one honest verifier is required to keep optimistic rollups secure (as in, every other verifier could be dishonest and it wouldn’t matter).

Zero Knowledge rollups, on the other hand, don’t need validators nor verifiers, instead using cryptography to prove the validity of every batch of transactions as it happens. Since every batch has an automatic proof of its own validity, no additional consensus or verification on transactions is necessary. While this is more secure, it is also more data intensive.

&#x200B;

[Source: msfew.eth](https://preview.redd.it/gku36rog9boa1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b587169887b9ccddb0ee4194f2674e1f95158c61)

Currently, only optimistic rollups can be EVM-equivalent.\* Zero knowledge rollups can’t perform the same complex transactions, since complexity makes generating those proofs more difficult. As a result, optimistic rollups seem to be better for elaborate applications, whereas zero knowledge rollups can be better for processing many simple transactions.

\*The challenges towards creating EVM-equivalent zero knowledge rollups are significant, but there are companies working on these challenges and this could change in the future.

&#x200B;

# Why We Need Rollups

Rollups make fewer compromises to achieve scalability compared to sidechains. Only one honest verifier is required to keep an optimistic rollup secure; every other verifier could be dishonest and it wouldn’t matter. Optimistic rollups need 1/n honest verifiers, and anyone can become a verifier, but sidechains need 1/2 honest validators, and not anyone can become a validator.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mq3vhv9u9boa1.jpg?width=636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=02bc9a52440196867d7f65f2bc99bb8e4cad86cf

Zero knowledge rollups don’t even need verifiers, but their applications are limited, at least currently. Rollups are centralized as far as their sequencers go, but decentralized alternatives may emerge. Rollups can become fully decentralized, whereas sidechains cannot. Further, assets are retrievable from rollups even if the companies behind them stop operating. The same is not true for sidechains, where assets are irretrievable if the sidechain stops operating.

Rollups are the best type of Layer 2 we have, and are seeing increasing prominence in Ethereum development. EIPs and upgrades are increasingly trying to make rollups even cheaper to use, in an effort to increase their capacity even more. In recent years, Ethereum has even moved to a rollup-centric roadmap.

If an upgrade can make Layer 1 costs 10x cheaper, that could lead to 100x or even 1000x cost savings on rollups, or a capacity to handle that many more transactions. It therefore makes sense that rollups will facilitate an increasing share of Ethereum transactions.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Layer 2's Today

Relatively speaking, sidechains are the easiest type of Layer 2 to deploy, and one that gives it’s creators notable control. The Polygon Foundation was able to [increase gas fees](https://thedefiant.io/polygon-transaction-fee-hike) at a moment’s notice to combat what they perceived to be on-chain spam. This centralized control also lead to the $622 million [hack of the Axie sidechain](https://decrypt.co/96322/hacker-622-million-axie-infinity-ronin-ethereum). Both a blessing and a curse, it is likely more sidechains will exist in the future. Their relative ease to develop is likely why we’ve seen sidechains emerge ahead of rollups.

Optimism and Arbitrum publicly launched in 2021 and together have grown to hold over $5.5 billion in assets, as of today. Both are optimistic rollups and with many applications on them. Currently only Artbitrum, the larger of the two, is EVM-equivalent. While Optimism can execute most transactions the same way Ethereum would, but not all. Both networks require ETH to pay for gas. 

Companies including Starkware (previously Cairo) and Loopring are developing Zero-Knowledge rollups, with versions already live to the public, but limited in the types of transactions they can handle. The term “zkEVM” has been a buzzword recently as Zero Knowledge rollups continue trying to become EVM-equivalent, but it is not clear if this is possible. 

&#x200B;

# In Conclusion

Naturally, Ethereum is limited. There’s only so much block space for transactions, and there are very good reasons why expanding block size doesn’t solve the problem (see my [Data Availability write-up here](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/merkle-trees-how-blockchain-data)). Instead, to allow more people to access the benefits of blockchain, we must expand the space we already have. This is what Layer 2’s accomplish. Rollups make the least compromises, and will likely be Ethereum’s foremost scaling solution.

I see staking on a protocol similar to paying your partner dues at a law firm. You are financially committing to providing a service and maintaining the overall integrity of the firm (or protocol).

624,"Multisig wallets (eg. [Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/)) are an easy and safe way to store funds, and can give you most of the key benefits of **self-custody** - namely, your funds not being subject to disappearing because a centralized entity that seemed trustworthy turns out not to be at all - without the risks of having to be personally responsible for your entire security setup. I use a multisig wallet personally to store the bulk of my funds, as does the Ethereum Foundation.

A close cousin of multisig wallets is [social recovery wallets](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html), where a single key can be used to sign transactions but if that key is lost, a group of keys held by other people can be used to recover the funds. Social recovery wallets are much easier than multisig wallets to use, especially with the rise of [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) account abstraction and upcoming wallets like [Soul Wallet](https://twitter.com/zengjiajun_eth/status/1636496326723768320) that will make the technology user-friendly. In general, once social recovery wallets become mature enough, my recommendation will be to use social recovery for hot wallets that store a small portion of a person or organization's funds, and multisigs for cold wallets that store a person or organizations's savings.

Both multisig wallets and social recovery wallets rely on a concept of **guardians**: a set of N addresses, typically held by other people, of which any M can approve an operation (eg. one could set N=6 and M=4). In the case of a multisig wallet, each transaction must be signed off on by M of the N guardians. In the case of a social recovery wallet, there is a single key that can sign transactions, but if that key is lost, M of the N guardians must sign a message to reset the key.

**Two key questions in using multisig wallets and social recovery wallets securely are: (i) whom do you choose as guardians, and (ii) what instructions do you give them?** This post will outline how I think about this issue. The ideas here should mostly apply equally to multisig and social recovery wallets being used to secure funds for individuals and for organizations.

### What do we want out of guardians?

* Minimize the chance that they lose their keys
* Minimize the chance that they collude to steal your money, or get coerced into doing so
* To the extent that the above two risks are unavoidable, the risk of each guardian should be maximally _uncorrelated_ - you want to minimize commonalities that risk situations that will disable or compromise too many of your guardians at the same time.

This answer is simple and short, but it guides all of the choices that I make with regard to guardians.

### It's okay for some of the guardians to be your own devices, but not too many

It makes natural sense to have at least one guardian be a wallet on one of your own devices - it doesn't reduce decentralization to do that, and after all, it _is_ your money. Once you go above one guardian controlled by yourself, however, you get into a tricky tradeoff: you get to trust other people less, but you're also concentrating more power into yourself, which can create a risk if you get hacked, coerced, or incapacitated or die.

My rule of thumb is that enough guardians should be controlled by other people that if you disappear there are enough other guardians left to recover your funds. That is, **you should control at least 1 guardian, and at most N-M guardians**. Also, each guardian should be on a separate device (laptop, phone, old phone, etc).

### Choose guardians who do not often talk to each other or ideally do not know each other

Ideally, the guardians should not know who each other are. This greatly reduces the risk that they collude, and furthermore there is _no good reason_ for them to know each other. If something happens to you, they will still be able to find each other, because there are obvious standard protocols that naturally come to people's minds in such a situation (eg. contact your family).

Also, you want to **minimize correlations between your guardians as much as possible**: don't choose two guardians who live in the same city (or ideally even the same country), or two guardians who use the same type of wallet, and have a balance between different operating systems.

### Guardians should ask a security question before approving an operation

When you ask a guardian to approve an operation for you (in a multisig, this would be any transaction, and in a social recovery wallet, this would be resetting your account's key), they should not simply say yes immediately. This would be a disaster for security: if someone hacks into your chat account, they could scan your messages, figure out who your guardians are, contact each of them and ask them to confirm, and thereby steal your funds.

My preferred protocol to avoid this is to instruct guardians to **ask a security question**. That is, when you ask for a confirmation on your operation, the guardian should ask you something that only the two of you and very few other people know (eg. ""the last time we met, what kind of food did we have?""), and only confirm the operation if you give the correct answer. A natural alternative is voice or video calls, but in the age of AI deepfakes this is weaker evidence than before, and so you may want to combine the voice/video call with asking some kind of security question.

### If you're doing ""degen"" stuff, make sure to have guardians who can respond quickly. Otherwise, this doesn't matter

If you're doing degen stuff with on-chain contracts, you may need to act quickly: pull money out if a contract gets a vulnerability, move money around if you are close to being liquidated, etc. If your needs include this, then you want to find guardians who can act quickly on short notice (and therefore also, guardians in different time zones, so enough guardians to complete a transaction are awake at all times) to protect your funds. If you do not do these kinds of things, however, then speed is not particularly important, and in fact may even be slightly harmful, because convincing people of the need to act urgently is a common social engineering tactic used by hackers and it can be good to have people who are by default mentally averse to that.

### Test each guardian at least once a year

Make a test operation at least once a year. Ideally, make two test operations each year, using half your guardians for one and the other half of your guardians for the other. This makes sure that your guardians haven't forgotten or lost their accounts.

### Advanced: privacy

One of the challenges with guardians today is that the tech does not yet exist to make it possible to protect your financial privacy from your guardians. However, this is a technical problem that can be solved technically: instead of guarding your account directly, the guardians guard a ""lockbox"" contract where the link between your account and the lockbox is hidden. Making the link stay hidden until a recovery needs to be made is pretty easy: for example, your account could have as a guardian a CREATE2 contract that only the lockbox can create. Making the link stay hidden _even after_ a recovery, however, requires more advanced ZK-SNARK tech. Hence, this is a problem that I expect will slowly be solved over the next few years.",2023-03-17 05:51:13

643,"Edit: title should end with ""stealth-addresses"". Somehow accidentally deleted it.

Over the past I've come across multiple instances in the news, where motivated actors (govt, media, etc.) act against privacy tools and also privacy coins etc. You can find plenty of examples online on that - and there are even gag letters, which companies get where they are forced to implement certain backdoors into their cloud services and they're not allowed to tell anyone about it.

And that's only the stuff we know about.

With this agenda, privacy coins/tools like Monero, Tornado Cash, etc. ars also targeted. I won't discuss the relationship to money laundering now. But the point is, that these actors have lots of incentives to discourage widespread usage of these things. The popularity of bitcoin and ethereum is likely not too strongly attacked, because the Blockchains are completely public and it's easy for existing large scale data globbling systems to connect people via their KYC at exchanges to their wallet addresses.

My hypothesis is, that when ethereum eventually moves to a privacy-by-default stealth address-based system, these actors will use lots of power and techniques to avoid this from happening. They could use all kinds of nice and not-so-nice techniques and for instance keep the ethereum foundation from actually working on this. 

As the saying goes (afaik). The bear won't attack you, as long as you don't attack/threaten it's power. The ethereum foundation would probably have been much more in cross-fire if ethereum had been privacy-first since the beginning.

My worry is, that our goals of privacy in the future could get sabotaged/stopped - leaving us with an incomplete Blockchain and unfulfilled vision.

Yes, there will be still privacy L2s and smart contracts. But they don't work as good, if they are opt-in. After NSA revelations, everyone started taking encryption seriously. Encryption is opt-out now. All by default is encrypted. Privacy should be opt-out and not opt-in.

**""insufficient funds”** is one of the seldom situations where the error message tells what the error really is. 

BUT!!! **“gas required exceeds allowance (0)”** means the same. It also happens when funds for transactions are insufficient.  StackOverflow and other parts of the Internet are full of these questions. But no one tells you that you just need to add more funds on the signing wallet. This is what I found out today.

I think the difference is that if the funds are under a certain threshold, then the latter message comes, in all other cases the first one.

652,"It was a late night, and I was about to go to bed when I received an airdrop message in telegram in the clone announcement group of a project that I had been active in. (**IdenaAnnouncement**) The group didn't look suspicious, and it even had a history of previous news from the project. I assumed that it was a real announcement channel (**IdenaAnnouncements**), but I failed to notice that it was actually a group and not a channel. The scammers had put restrictions on every member so that they couldn't write anything. As you can see the difference in names between the fake one and the real one is only in one letter \`s\`.

I followed the link, and the website looked quite professional. However, it requested access to my MetaMask wallet. Since I didn't have much money in it, I assumed that the official channel couldn't do any scam. I had been in this project for years. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a contract that took all of my money (about $47).

Here are some key takeaways from my experience that might help others avoid getting scammed:

1. Adjust your privacy settings to prevent anyone from adding you to groups without your consent.
2. Scammers are increasingly personalizing their attacks, parsing group members and imposing restrictions on them individually.
3. They also create fake members to make the group appear genuine and lure people into clicking on links.
4. The name of the fake group might be very similar to the original one, with just a small difference in spelling.
5. Always check is it a group with restrictions or is it a channel?

I realize now that I made a mistake, but scammers are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated. It's important to be cautious and vigilant to protect ourselves from their schemes.

I hope that my message helped people avoid being potentially scammed.

PROOF OF OWNERSHIP  
 NON FUNGIBLE TOKEN specifically addresses the issues of Proof of Ownership through it’s unique smart contract deployed at the time of launch of a product. NFTBOOKS can precisely use the NFT features to address the Authors' most underlined issue of duplication & ownership being compromised. In NFTBOOKS, the ownership of a book is in the form of an NFT & is recorded on the blockchain, and can be transferred by the owner, allowing NFTs to be sold and traded. Each NFT has a unique smart contract and hence proponents of NFTs can claim a public certificate of authenticity or proof of ownership.

CHEAP BOOKS FOR READERS FROM LENDERS 

Whoever owns a book or multiple books can create a personal library with NFTBOOKS and can lend them to readers for rent. The availability of many such personally owned libraries with NFTBOOKS can create competition among lenders to lend books at the cheapest cost and hence, readers can go to the cheapest available book on the NFT marketplace of NFTBOOKS and on every resale or borrowing Royalty Income could be generated for original creator. 

NO MIDDLEMAN 

Unlike existing online self publishing platforms (for example Amazon) where huge royalty income goes to the platform, with NFTBOOKS, authors can receive up to 99% the price of their books.

ROYALTY (PERPETUAL) Earnings FOR AUTHORS 

An NFT can give the Royalty Earnings to the ORIGINAL CREATOR every time it gets transferred to a new buyer. How? 

Each NFT can be registered with its own percentage of Royalty Earnings when the smart contract is deployed. And hence, every time a book is resold from one person to another, a certain percentage of Royalty Earnings (decided before the book is published) go to the Original Creator of that NFT (BOOK). Which will result in maximizing the authors' income.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I would really appreciate the input of those who can guide me to resources relative to understanding how cryptocurrency APIs interact specifically. 

As an entrepreneur, I currently have a team of four individuals waiting to be hired to develop an initial project. They're skilled software graduates from Humber college specializing in data science, full-stack development, machine learning, etc. 

Here's my problem: I must provide a technical manager that can give them guidance for at least an hour per week. I understand that most blockchain applications have dev communities for people to ask questions and learn as they build. So I planned to outsource these students to communities they could leverage whenever they need the support. 

I only have a month to be able to work with them, from March 15 to April 20. 

Should I get these students to work on developing a DAPP? Or, with the timeframe provided, focus on making one minimal viable product really good and open to the public on a website?

TLDR: I'm working with a dev team for a month, don't know if I should challenge their abilities by developing a DAPP, or stick with a traditional software application.",2023-03-12 03:38:35

We're not doing a good job promoting the use of Rai. This is bad, and you should feel bad. Let's use Rai more, and here's a way to do it.

# USDC is a crutch

Recent events with Dai and USDC prove yet again why stablecoins backed by USD are toxic assets. The reality, [as Arthur Hayes put it](https://youtu.be/vSvVkm7gViE?t=2518), is that DeFi will always be hamstrung if we depend on US dollar stability. It introduces centralization risks, and also draws the ire of regulators who want bond stability. When you realize all liquid stablecoins are backed mostly by US treasury bonds, guarded by centralized commercial banks, you realize just how this house of cards can fall. When certain market conditions are met, the bonds are liquidated at market rates, where you may receive $0.94 on every dollar.

**Oh wait, that's what just happened**

You can do research on bond mechanics and how the combination of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank destroyed the value of USDC, but look no further than the PSM on Dai to see how destructive this crutch is. [It currently stands at 63% USDC](https://daistats.com/#/overview) as everyone panic sold USDC for Dai to get out of fears that Circle was undercollateralized, [which it turns out they are](https://www.circle.com/blog/an-update-on-usdc-and-silicon-valley-bank). 

# Stop using USDC challenge

Now here's the hard part. I know you want to larp as a decentralization maxi, but it's time to stop it and actually be a decentralization maxi. Here's how you can do it.

## As a user

As a user, how can you promote Rai? By actually using Rai. Instead of going to conferences and larping about how great ETH is, but then splitting bills with Venmo, why don't use use Rai?

- Buy some Rai
- Use it to split bills with other DeFi native people.

I understand risks that it could go down, so just use Rai in a small fashion just to get used to it. You don't need to go crazy and buy $100K in Rai, but keep a small amount on a layer 2 and slosh it around.

## As a DeFi trader.

Big bag boys, have I got news for you. Rai is currently paying you to generate it. As it stands, it has [over 4% APY](https://stats.reflexer.finance/) to mint new RAI. How does it work? [The stability peg is currently negative](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/stability-without-pegs-8c6a1cbc7fbd).

- Make a Reflexer Safe and generate Rai. Long ETH using Reflexer bonds.
- Take the Rai and market make with it. Preferably on L2s.

Now here's the interesting part? Want leverage? Use DeFi Saver to mint new RAI and rebuy ETH. [You can do this in 1 swap and have some good capital efficiency](https://app.defisaver.com/reflexer/manage).

## As a Project Owner

This is an interesting part. You're a project owner, so you have sweet yield farming rewards for people who want to use your project. I want to ask, why are you using anything else but Rai as the base token in your project? Why are you doing ICOs with USDC? Why is your NFT project selling in Dai/USDC and not even giving the option for Rai? Rai is right there. Use it. Help bootstrap Rai liquidity. Why should you do this you ask? Well even if you complain about the possibility of Rai going down in value, considering this weekend USDC dropped to $0.88, you clearly do not have the safety you think you have. You have just as much volatility risk as Rai already, except you also have the trust risk where you hope to god Circle or the Bitfinex Cartel actually has the bonds they say they do. You are effectively ignoring your risks, while Rai's risks are right in front of you and clear. You're just risking your project, and may wake up one day with $0.50 on every USDC. Here's an idea:

- Stop doing token raises with USDC. Use Rai.
- Generate yield farm liquidity with Rai. Preferably run your yield farm programs on L2s so general users can access Rai.
- Promote Rai. Use Rai as payment tokens for your merch. Support Rai in your app as a base token. Use Rai as a payment for conferences. Enjoy Rai within your organization and offer it as salaries.

# Fin

If you've made it this far, I hope you're now thinking. You're all far too deep into USD stablecoins, and you don't realize you are not supporting decentralized finance. Every USD has a link to a commercial US bank, regulated by the government, and will always be crutched by regulators who manage bond volatility. The next few weeks, you will see people use the recent bank failures as an excuse to regulate these tokens further, as they are directly linked to US treasuries markets. This is foolish. Simplify your risks. Rai is risky, but it's simplified risks backed by pure ETH.

**We need you to help promote Rai**

The hard part? You're not going to get rich doing it. It's not like promoting your digital beanie babies or new yield farm. It won't make you a token billionaire. No one is making a yield farm strategy for Rai, because it's already mostly crystalized. The project owners aren't going to get rich from it, and neither will you. It's an already deployed token, that has been in the wild for over a year, that's just sitting there waiting for you to realize it's use. Use it.

# A note from Satoshi

The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

702,"As blockchain-based games continue to gain popularity, more and more developers are turning to the Ethereum blockchain to build their gaming platforms. This is not surprising, considering the numerous benefits that the Ethereum blockchain offers over others imo. 

Some of the key benefits of the Ethereum blockchain include:

* **Smart contract functionality**: Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to introduce smart contracts which allows for the automation of complex business and financial processes without the need for intermediaries. 
* **Developer community**: Ethereum has one of the largest and most active developer communities which has resulted in the creation of a number of libraries, tools and frameworks making it easier for gaming developers to build here. 
* **Flexibility**: Ethereum is a highly flexible platform which allows the creation of a wide range of dApps going beyond financial applications and towards the gaming sector too, making it more ideal.  
* **Interoperability**: Ethereum's compatibility with other blockchains through its use of smart contract programming languages like Vyper allows for the construction of decentralized applications (including games) that can interact with multiple blockchain networks. 

Some examples of popular games built on Ethereum blockchain include:  
1) **Axie Infinity**\- a popular game that allows players to collect, breed, and battle fantasy creatures called Axies.  
2) **Gods Unchained**\-  a digital trading card game that allows players to collect and battle with unique cards.  
3) **Vulcan Verse**\- an open world blockchain game built by Vulcan Forged where you can travel around and interact with games and events.   
4) **The Sandbox**\- a virtual world that allows players to buy and sell virtual land and assets.

Overall, in addition to the above-mentioned features, its decentralization, transparency and security make it an idea platform for building games involving digital assets and its benefits are clear.

I'm the founder of DEEP 42, a Decentralized Entertainment and Engagement Platform. We've recently launched our website and our first game is now available to play!

Our goal is to create a platform where multiple games can be played, and users on the platform can earn governance tokens for engaging. With these tokens, users can create proposals or vote on created proposals to steer the direction of the platform. This includes gameplay balancing, development of new games, steering of the community treasury, and layer 2 solutions.

Our first game revolves around the care and growth of ""Charlys,"" which are dynamic NFTs used as the basis for characters. Players can clean, feed, and play a mini-game in Unity with their minted characters, and with enough care, players can evolve their characters, enhancing their attributes and changing their visual appearance. We're currently working on a battle game where users can compete with their evolved characters against each other and AI.

To kickstart our decentralization process, we'll be launching an Airdrop Campaign soon. We believe the only way to achieve true decentralization is to distribute tokens fairly and get as many people as possible to participate. We have a plan for this that we'll be sharing in the coming days.

718,"I'm trying to understand the resillience and security as well as censorship resistance of the Ethereum smart contracts space. I'm fairly new, so please understand,if my question is already resolved/easy to answer.

WalletConnect is the most widely used standard for dapps and wallets to be agnostic to the concrete counterparty they are connecting to. I was asking myself, how resillient this setup is.

For instance, if a dapp's UI is hosted on ipfs and it connects via metamask, then that connection is directly via the browser and local (afaik), and it cannot be intercepted (assuming browser not hacked etc.).

However, with WalletConnect there are relays running on wallet-connects servers which make this concrete connection between the dapp and the wallet. This is a centralised security/censorship issue. [As far as I can see, it's not possible to host these relays yourself at the moment.](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/faq). 

I also don't know the specifics of WalletConnect relays. What is the worst thing that can happen, if they become compromised? Can compromised servers deny people using a dapp? Can compromised servers make nasty things via mitm attacks?

I am aware, that the direct interaction with the smart contract can happen without the UI. But I don't think that the majority of users in crypto can actually do that when in emergency.

Given the value of decentralisation and Trustlessness, I am not sure, whether the widespread of WalletConnect relays is really all that ok. After all, if a powerful actor wants, they might approach the WalletConnect and force them to change their servers to do a specific thing.

It would be great, if this couldn't be used for censorship just like the tornado cash was blacklisted.

How do i provide liquidity?

The real estate value is somehow translated in tokens ( tokenization if I am correct)
After this step, sell the tokens for  fiat, which goes to liquidty pool.

My question is, how do I get the exact or close to exact value for a smart contract token. Like if metamask, bscan, zerion all these apps are giving me a value for the amount of a specific token, how do I swap and receive that amount in eth or bsc??

I’m guessing it goes off liquidity, if that’s the case, how do i check to see which coin is providing most liquidity for that contract so i can swap for that coin.

**Pooja Ranjan**

If you want to know what is currently going on in Ethereum development then Pooja should probably be your first source. If you only follow her sites listed below you will understand more than 99% of crypto users. Do be aware it isn't aimed at complete newbies, it's for people who already have a bit of familiarity with the chain and want to stay as up to date as possible without needing to spend 25 hours a day following the progress of different teams, EIPs, discussions etc. If you know a little about Ethereum already and want to have the best 'alpha' on what is coming, without any shilling/hype etc, there is probably no better follow.

**Mary Maller**

Dr Maller is a ZK researcher at the Ethereum Foundation; and not 'researcher' as in *""I did my own research by watching someone shill their shitcoin on Youtube""*, but 'researcher' as in *""constantly publishing in academic journals on cutting edge cryptographic topics""*. We are already starting to see the early excitement build up around ZKEVMs and other zero knowledge projects, the odds are that any you happen upon will be built on top of mathematics that Mary has contributed to.

**Anett Rolikova**

Self-described 'Ethereum Sunshine', Anett has contributed to a bunch of projects, probably the most useful to me personally being her 'curated crypto list', which serves as an unbeatable starting place for anyone getting started in their Ethereum journey. Someone linked me to this list about 4 years ago and it was fundamental in making the task of getting to grips with Ethereum manageable. If you're feeling overwhelmed at the challenge of comprehending what this whole space is about: you want to learn more but don't know where to start then the answer is here:

**Camila Russo**

If you haven't heard of Cami Russo yet, then it is very likely that you will in the next year or so. She has written a book on the early days of Ethereum called *'The Infinite Machine'* which is currently being made into a movie by Ridley Scott's studio... yea that Ridley Scott studios, who also produced Alien, Gladiator, Bladerunner and some of the other most popular movies of all time! The story is pretty fascinating, and when the movie comes out it should take Ethereum another big step towards wider recognition in the general public.

 * https://thedefiant.io/scott-free-infinite-machine

She also founded and runs one of the most trustworthy crypto news sources - The Defiant. It focuses on DeFi, with plenty of developer interviews, use and presentation of on-chain data, etc etc:

**Anna Rose**

Anna Rose is one of the main links between the highly academic world of Zero Knowledge research and the average, less technically specialized user. She is basically involved in Zero Knowledge everything...

 * Podcast: https://zeroknowledge.fm/episodes/

 * Conferences: https://www.zksummit.com/

 * Jobs board: https://jobsboard.zeroknowledge.fm/

If you are interested in this 'ZK' stuff that you have heard will be the next big thing, but don't have a PhD in Cryptography then you are potentially easy prey for the shills of countless projects, who will use buzzwords and bullshit to convince you to buy into things you don't fully understand. Anna's content will give you the knowledge to know your SNARKs from your STARKs, and your PLONK from your Plonky2, so you can have a better chance of picking the really promising projects from those that just have a big marketing budget or desperate bagholders.

**Frederika Ernst**

Dr Ernst is a host of Epicentre, one of the most well researched and non-shilly crypto podcasts. Their guests are industry leading builders and thinkers, but the hosts always push back on any unsubstantiated claims and demand further explanation of anything that sounds unlikely or overly optimistic. They have always done their research and the questions asked demonstrate a level of understanding that makes it almost impossible for the listener to come away without learning from every episode. You should be a listener if you want a general crypto podcast that never seems like the guests are just being allowed to hype up their projects.

 * https://epicenter.tv/hosts/friederike-ernst/

She is also the COO of Gnosis, the scaling solution formerly known as xDAI, that POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) run on. POAPs are collectable badges that have become an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem, if you watch a big event live (like The Merge) then you can usually get a POAP, if you participate in a DAO governance call then you can usually get a POAP, if you go to an Ethereum conference then you will probably end up with a walletful of POAPs! Gnosis is also home to plenty of other dApps, a nicely decentralized staking community and all the usual sort of things a sidechain would want.

**Taylor Monahan**

If you were around in Ethereum before 'The DAO' or joined any time up to the first ICO mania then you are pretty likely to remember Taylor, even if you didn't know here name. She was one of the founders of the first easy to use Ethereum wallet (My Ether Wallet), before which we had to wait to sync the chain before making transactions (was that Parity, Myst, ?, I don't remember). This was an absolute game changer and allowed many more people to start accessing Ethereum... just in time for them to faced with a barrage of new 'Initial Coin Offerings', investments with varying degrees of legitimacy. As well as being partially responsible for enabling the chaos that ensued, Taylor also took it upon herself to try and call out scams and terrible investment 'opportunities' that newbies were falling for. If you look her up on Twitter you'll see that she still is still doing this, though now working for the ecosystem's current main wallet Metamask.

**Pulja Ohlhaver**

Pulja has become well more know in the Ethereum community following the publication of the paper 'Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul', of which she is a co-author. This was what sparked the conversations around soul-bound tokens and their uses in the middle of last year, it also talks about the state and future of many aspects of the space that are key to governance, such as Sybil resistance, quadratic funding and social recovery wallets, all of which are becoming increasingly important in DAOs and Web 3.0 in general.

 * https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763

She is a big picture / long game thinker for what the crypto ecosystem could become, if we can navigate our way there without falling into corporate/governmental control on one side of the ridge or fraudsters and scams on the other. If you haven't read the paper yet then I highly recommend it, or at the very least listen to her explain it.

 * Bottom up Building: Pathways towards a Decentralized Society [DevCon 6]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JpBmA-8FVc

Like everyone else on this list, Pulja has a variety of other contributions, such as being the Strategy Counsel at FlashBots (the MEV research and development organization).

**Simona Pop**

Simona is a DAO governance and public good thought-leader and advocate; a key contributor to Gitcoin (the biggest public goods funding platform in the ecosystem) and the organizer of Schelling Point (probably the biggest 'regen' conference). She was also a co-founder of 'Bounties Network', a platform similar(ish) to 'Fiver' for Web3.0 where freelancers can be paid for doing everything from finding a bug in some code, translating documentation t another language or even planting a tree... she's one of the many people in Ethereum community working hard to realize a vision of a better future, by building it.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

```
web3_utity = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(""https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"", request_kwargs={'timeout': 50}))

- Question: Im assuming this is caused by the server rpc node: 'bsc-dataseed.binance.org', anti-scrap. Note that 'bsc-dataseed.binance.org' is binance's public rpc note, if I buy some other rpc node service, connect to those rpcs, will it solve the connection error? If not, what can I do?

790,"# The Need for Queues

Today there are just over half a million Ethereum validators around the world, collectively staking 17.2 million ETH (about 14% of the total supply). To keep this validator set healthy, it should be protected from any drastic changes in number for security. If the number of validators could increase or decrease very quickly, this could be employed as a tactic in orchestrating an attack. 

https://preview.redd.it/8td8awbkrjla1.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1b4adf7facc14aa97c8db216953459814fd2e8f

A party could potentially exit a large number of validators, immediately causing a scare and others to exit, then instantly activate twice the amount of validators and gain significant control over the network. If there were no buffers to exit and entry, this could be a serious vulnerability to Ethereum. Beyond the queues, there are additional penalties to those that perform a malicious action (like proposing two different blocks at once) and are slashed.

&#x200B;

# Unstaking on Ethereum

The Shanghai hard fork introduces withdrawals for which information is written into a new space on Ethereum blocks, without the need to pay for gas. There are two queues withdrawers must go through to withdraw their ETH. The first is the exit queue and is somewhat slow, the other is the withdrawal queue and is much faster.

https://preview.redd.it/bxr5idw2sjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4624231b38e2d29bd543abe7b32815ccbaffa6d4

The slower exit queue is only necessary to enter if a validator is trying to withdraw all of their staked ETH (the principal + rewards), in which case it’s called a full withdrawal. The exit queue allows 7-8 full withdrawals to happen every 32 blocks. The number of withdrawals permitted in such a period is called the “churn limit,” and increases as more validators become active. Once a validator intending a full withdrawal goes through this exit queue, they’ll arrive in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators (approximately 1/5th of the current set) 63 days to go through the exit queue.

The faster withdrawal queue processes a maximum of 16 full or partial withdrawals every block (or every 12 seconds). A partial withdrawal happens automatically and disburses rewards earned by validators to addresses they designate to receive those rewards. Both of these are viewed as being equal in the withdrawal queue. It would take 100,000 validators 20 hours to go through the withdrawal queue.

There is a prerequisite to entering either of the queues above: validators must ensure that withdrawal addresses are updated and refer to valid addresses on Ethereum (technically, in the 0x01 format). This can be done now, and doing so will place rewards for those validators in the withdawal queue automatically once Shanghai goes live.

&#x200B;

# Impacts of Unstaking

While likely that many will want to unstake their ETH initially, the capacity for validators to withdraw is throttled. The reason is so that the validator set doesn’t change too drastically in too short a time. For the same reason, a queue exists to begin staking ETH. This also impacts the price of ETH, which won’t see the supply dump many prophesize.

https://preview.redd.it/7bis8l4trjla1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bfa6319f9584eef98ba10a014ae0f18ef987ebb7

It is likely that even amongst those who unstake, a significant portion will start staking again shortly thereafter. This is because many will be shifting from one staking service to another, something they can’t do until they unstake first. A further incentive is in the rewards rate, which increases as the validator set gets smaller.

Finally, the automatic disbursement of rewards will be exciting to look forward to. It introduces new liquidity into the Ethereum ecosystem directly, as opposed to having it locked up with the ETH that’s being staked. Ever since the Merge happened, validators have not received their rewards for validating the blockchain, the rewards are locked with the staked ETH. The additional \~0.2 ETH per block added directly into the ecosystem should have some interesting effects.

# In Conclusion

It’s fascinating that staking withdrawals are right around the corner. The conversation around whether to include withdrawals in the Shanghai hard fork was a big reason this newsletter started. It seemed necessary that as many of us in Ethereum as possible be knowledgeable about upcoming upgrades so that we can lend our support to the ones we consider most important.

792,"I am still in the learning fase and new to crypto, trying to learn as much as possible. While doing some research and trying to understand about Ethereum I stumbled upon multiple wallets like this one:

https://etherscan.io/address/0x7e5f4552091a69125d5dfcb7b8c2659029395bdf

As you can see, on a regular basis a transaction comes in, than for every transaction within seconds a (near) zero transaction is done with a TXN fee as high as the incoming Eth, keeping the balance up to zero.

Those who know what this is, could you explain me? Also where do the TXN fees go in this case?

(Act like I am an ignorant grandma because as I said,  at this point I still don't have much knowledge)

Tnx in advance! :)",2023-03-03 14:21:17

The standard has been implemented via the smart contract EntryPoint. This smart contract will reportedly alter how users interact with wallet services.

Most Ethereum’s existing wallets are owned by third parties (EOA). The list, which includes providers such as MetaMask and imToken, represents the vast majority of wallets available in the ecosystem. It even extends to hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano, where only one key controls an account. If a user loses their key, or it is compromised, tokens within the wallet are compromised as well.",2023-03-03 09:41:43
796,"What is the KZG Ceremony? -> [https://ceremony.ethereum.org/](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/)

I joined the queue around 8 days also with three submissions I wanted to make. Little did I know, that my Laptop would need to stay on and online for the next week at minimum.

A week ago, the lobby size was around 5000 (meaning 5000 people were waiting to be randomly selected every 3 minutes). This corresponds to a chance of **1.3% per hour**.

My first contribution was via the Website and surprisingly it was randomly selected after a day of waiting. The lobby size was also around 5k back then.

Yesterday, I got lucky and my second submission was also randomly selected and accepted:

    2023-03-02 00:03:19 Still isn't our turn, waiting 30s for retrying...
    Waiting for our turn to contribute...
    2023-03-02 00:03:49 Still isn't our turn, waiting 30s for retrying...
    Waiting for our turn to contribute...
    It's our turn! Contributing...
    Contribution ready, took 4.85s
    Sending contribution...
    Success!

Hurray!!

I still have my third contribution waiting. But now the lobby consists of **19000 participants!** This corresponds to a per hour selection probability of around **0.34% per hour**! That means, that with **50% probability, you will be picked within 8.5days**! (Assuming, the number of lobby participants stay the same... which likely will not. 50% = (1 - 0.34%)^(8.5 \* 24) ). Let's not forget, that the KZG Ceremony only lasts for another 10 days from today.

What do you say? What kinds of successes / waiting times did you have or do you still have?",2023-03-03 00:04:08
