**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Today, independently by the time frame I set, the supply is negative of only -0,7%.

The first explication that came to my mind was that eth went inflationary again for some time due to lower activity on the network.

But, the base fee window reports that eth has always been deflationary for the last 30 days. So, how's possible that the supply went up on the last few days (from -1% to -0,7%) with a persistent deflationary status of eth during the last 30 days?"

I've been looking into depositing some rEth into Aave but before I go ahead and do it I would like to ask if I have understood the fees I can expect to pay reasonably well.

Due to fees I haven't used main chain very much for years.

Here's is my idea of how it would roughly look like:

3.31, withdraw cex

15.6, swap to reth

20.5 approve reth spend

20.5 deposit

20.5, approve borrow coin

20.5, eithdraw borrow coin

20.5, repay borrow coin

20.5 withdraw rEth

This has led to the launch of many scaling solutions known as Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions with most solutions differing from the others. The 4 prominent approaches taken are:

\-Sidechains (although many argue that it's not an L2. Example is Polygon and xDAI)

\- State channels (Connext, Celer, etc.)

\- Rollups which are divided into Optimistic (Arbitrum, Optimism, Cartesi, etc.) and ZK Rollups (Starknet, zkSync, Loopring, dYdX, etc.)

\- Nested Channels/Plasma such as OMG Network.

Arbitrum is the latest in the L2 wave after a successful token launch. A general-purpose optimistic rollup, Arbitrum is designed to improve speed and privacy while reducing txn fees on Ethereum networks significantly.

Then there is Cartesi, an application-specific optimistic rollup scaling solution that is approaching a [mainnet-ready stage](https://medium.com/cartesi/cartesi-ecosystem-update-2023-124b384401cc) with the scheduled release this year. Cartesi rollups offer lots of advantages like individual high-performing rollup chains for DApps in the Cartesi ecosystem, no competition of blockspace, and the same strong security and privacy of the underlying blockchain. These rollups can be deployed as layer 2 on top of Ethereum, layer 3 on top of L2s, or as sovereign Rollups.

The launch of the Cartesi mainnet will allow developers to break free from the current limitations of Ethereum VM and allow them to build DApps that can handle complex use cases. Don't miss the chance to learn more about Cartesi and how it can help you build more powerful DApps using familiar stacks and libraries at their upcoming [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ethmalaysia/events/292992230/).

The future of Ethereum scalability is promising, and it is exciting to witness the evolution of this technology as we move towards a more decentralized and efficient world."

While, for the tokens I work with, I need a token allowance to have the smart contract be able to spend it, I realised, that my smart contract could also simply just **itself invoke** the ERC20 [approve](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol#L66) function and give itself the allowance it needs to process my tokens.

While this may be convinient for my smart contract, I think this is highly problematic for the smart contracts in the wild. I mean, doesn't that mean, that as soon as I interact with a malicious smart contract, that it can simply give itself ALL approvals for the most common tokens and thereby drain the account? Is this the reason, why people say ""don't interact with smart contracts""?

Do I understand this situation correctly?

Not only is this problematic, but this also actually completely *negates the whole purpose of the allowances*. I mean, why does uniswap *even brother* to ask me for an approval and make one swap into two tx (approve + swap)? If I have to trust uniswap anyways to not make a malicious token approval call, then they might as well just approve the amount for the swap and execute the swap together in the same tx. Right?

What do you think? Am I missing something?

If this is really the way I describe, wouldn't it be necessary to implement guard-checks on the *msg.sender* side? Concretely, It would make more sense to have some kind of *account-side function approval*, where an account itself can specify, whether a certain function of a certain contract can be called by a smart contract or not. I could then say, that e.g. only Uniswap *even can call the approve function* of a token and any other contract attempting to call it would immediately revert. I think this is not implemented in the ecosystem and would need to be an EIP... right?"
35,2023-04-23,Creating many seed phrases from hardware wallets,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12wq548/creating_many_seed_phrases_from_hardware_wallets/,14,"I would like to create seed phrases for use in a software-based wallets and applications. But, I want these seed phrases to be derived from my hardware wallet, so with access only to the hardware wallet I can recreate the seed phrases. I want to generate potentially many of these, so it would be burdensome if I had to manage seed phrases for these new wallets separately. Also, these must be seed phrases and not just individual keys derived from the same HD wallet, since the many different applications I use them in only accept seed phrases.

Is there a standard for doing this in a way that does not expose my hardware wallet private key(s)?

I have come up with a method for generating seeds from my hardware wallet, without exposing the hardware wallet's seed phrase or private key, and I would like to know if it is sound.

1. Sign a particular message with your hardware wallet, such as ""My software wallet 156""

2. Double check that the signature is correct by recovering the public key from the signature using the message ""My software wallet 156"" (Optional check)

3. Take the keccak256 hash of the signature

4. Convert the hash to a 24-word seed phrase using BIP-39

Because in Ethereum we assume the one-wayness of the keccak256 hash, I think this should be a secure way of deriving a seed phrase (but, I am unsure). Also: I am signing these messages with my hardware wallet, so I do not leak the seed phrase or private keys of the hardware wallet. No one else can produce the signature as long as I keep the signature secret, and I assume my computer is trustworthy.

Possible threats:

1. If someone tricks me into signing the same message, thereby revealing the signature to them, the person can derive my seed and steal my funds. I will assume that no one can trick me into doing this, and that no one else ever has access to my hardware wallet.

2. Do different wallets sign messages in different ways? Signing the same message multiple times on my hardware wallet yields the same signature, so I assume the signature parameters are derived deterministically from the message contents. But, if a wallet signs the same message differently than when I first derive the seed, the seed might become irrecoverable.

3. Forgetting the message. I can store the message or message pattern along side my paper seed phrase backup so I cannot forget it. Storing the message pattern is compact, and I won't have to amend the paper backup every time I want to create a new software seed.

Thoughts?"

My current problem with L2s is they go the path of token governance which will never completly ossify. I know for example optimism would be easy to fork and create a version with no governance. The problem I see is all current major L2s that have or will have some kind of governance are building up a huge network effect, that other L2s with no governance in future will have a hard time to compete.

I'm here again unfortunately not with good news. I've fallen victim to another theft of my Ethereum & It's not the money that really has me upset but the fact that I just can't establish how this has happened.  


Everything I'm about to mention occurred on the ledger only. I merged some USDT ERC20 from one address of mine to another to bring my balance to a total of around 800-900 US dollars worth. That was before I went to sleep. Soon as I woke up and had a look balance was 0. :(((  


This was [my thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/pf6jn5/i_have_nothing_to_hide_but_im_getting_frustrated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from my old account back in 2021 when I initially lost some ETH overnight. **Exact same address > 0x7CCCa95154bF349275b776c2185DeecCBA7a3C64**  


Since the initial loss I had done the following:

* Contacted Ledger support
* Attempted to contact metamask support (They're good for nothing)
* Contacted the Golem network devs (I was doing a migration back in 2021)

I firstly want to point out that this is my legacy address on my Nano S (1st gen). I'm 1,000,000% certain I did not share my seed phrase with no one! Correct me if I'm wrong but had I did such a grave mistake wouldn't my entire ledger risk being wiped clean?  


I have a good eye for scams. I recognize them immediately. During the golem network I opted to use metamask since I couldn't migrate directly from the Ledger. I'm almost certain the add on I used on the browser was indeed the legitimate add-on.  


All my transactions have to be signed by me physically clicking both buttons on the ledger so please please can someone help me make sense of this please. I've ordered a new ledger for my own integrity I can't afford to lose any other digital assets.   


I know I'll never see that money again however it would give me a peace of mind to really understand how this even happened. How did they clear my ledger legacy ETH address meanwhile my other addresses on the same ledger hold way more money?  


At this point I'm willing to pay for an investigator if anyone has any recommendations.  


Thank you & stay safe"

The fact is that Ethereum Shapella hard fork last week was a major milestone on the network roadmap, however, it was just one step towards a fully scalable Ethereum ecosystem.   
 

Several more upgrades are slated for later this year and in the years to come and I must say that I'm really excited about what's to come, the only crypto I'm interested in this much is eth, other stuff that interests me is GameFi and gaming tokens - Axie, MagicCraft, and several others.    
 

I believe these upgrades will transform the network into a blazing-fast world computer and decentralized crypto-economy.   
 

I read that the next one is the Cancun hard fork which will implement EIP-4844 in the third or fourth quarter of 2023, and it will turbocharge rollups.   
 

Distributed Validator Technology is another major milestone on Ethereum’s roadmap. While the third one will be a proposer-builder separation. This aims to address the problems caused by MEV attacks

But do you think we need it?    
 

Billions of dollars have been poured into the space, many gaming giants are investing in Web3.    
 

I play several blockchain games, Splinterlands, CoinFantasy, Axie Infinity, etc. and I really think that idea of these games is amazing.   
 

But on the other hand what about scalability for example? Scalability is a recurring issue being faced in web3. Networks must be capable of handling massive amounts of data and transactions created by gaming apps quickly and efficiently.   
 

I am aware that layer 2 solutions such as Immutable X and Boba Network, enable games to run as cheaply as possible, without compromising on the user experience, but there's much more to achieve so these games can become worldwide popular.    
 

To truly bring web3 gaming to the masses, we must go beyond just marketing and outreach efforts.   
 

Another issue is that the regulatory and legal landscape for web3 is still largely uncharted territory, and navigating the complex issues of intellectual property, data privacy, and security requires expert legal counsel and strategic planning, to ensure the longevity of web3 gaming.   
 

So, what are your predictions for the mass adoption of Web3 gaming?"

With a hardware wallet, if the hardware wallet's company goes away and the wallet goes poof, I can still recover my funds in any BIP39 supported wallet.

What happens if Gnosis goes away? Can I still run the CLI on docker? What happens to the smart contract wallet/vault that's created? Where can I ""take"" it? Can it be imported into another multisig wallet?

Are multi sig wallets for individual custody overkill? Or with all the hacks and leaks going on, should I seriously consider it?"

I read yesterday that approximately 91,500 ETH was deposited and 64,830 ETH was withdrawn, creating a positive net staking balance of roughly 26,680 ETH ($53 million), according to data from token.unlocks.  


So, this follows the first positive net staking flow since Shapella went live. The Block reported yesterday that, over the previous 24 hours, 95,000 ETH was deposited against 27,000 ETH withdrawn.  


I remember the first crypto asset I invested in was the Coin Fantasy token followed by Eth and I remember how anxious I was about this upgrade when the speculation about it started. It seemed like an eternity.  


I noticed that Ethereum is burning more ether since Shapella. This nearly doubled the burn rate of the past 30 days and is significantly more than the post-Merge burn rate of 0.134% per year.

Everyone says that a validator may do this to be safe from his block getting orphaned, but i cant see why this will happen if he produced only one valid block, this will resolve the fork and he will get his reward. So how can his block get orphaned if he produces only one block?
I understand the part that an attacker may do this to double spend his coins, but i struggle to understand how the validators are economically incentivized to produce two blocks, after all, if a validator produces just one block, the other validators will vote on it, and the fork will resolve, right?
Any help will be appreciated."

As smart contract proxies are becoming more prevalent in the world of blockchain, it's important for end users to stay informed and understand the potential risks associated with them. I wanted to share some essential points that can help you stay safe while navigating this exciting ecosystem.

1. Function Clashing: Be cautious of function clashing, a potential vulnerability in smart contract proxies. This issue can lead to unintended behavior or exploitation by malicious actors. To spot function clashing, look for function names with seemingly random numbers or letters, like function superSafeFunction96508587, while appearing to be safe. Staying informed about function clashing can help you make more informed decisions when using DApps and other blockchain services.

2. Uninitialized Proxies: Keep an eye out for uninitialized proxy contracts, which can also pose security risks. To ensure a proxy has been initialized correctly, you can usually check the events of the contract creation transaction, as seen in this example: https://imgur.com/a/sE5sQGC. Alternatively, you can look through the proxy factory code (if available) and confirm that the initialization occurs in the same function as the deployment, as shown in this example: https://imgur.com/a/BjVapeU. Make sure to research and understand the contracts you interact with to minimize your exposure to potential vulnerabilities.

3. Selfdestruct Functionality: If a contract contains the selfdestruct keyword, it's essential to ensure the developers have taken necessary precautions to prevent potential risks. You can check the contract code for the presence of the selfdestruct keyword to identify this potential issue. Additionally, contracts deployed using the CREATE2 opcode could indicate suspicious activities. You can spot the contract creation using CREATE2 by examining the contract creation transaction on Etherscan. Use this image as guidance: https://imgur.com/a/L2YL14M.

Arming yourself with knowledge about these issues and more is crucial in the ever-evolving blockchain ecosystem. If you're interested in diving deeper into Ethereum smart contract proxies and their implications for both developers and security researchers, I invite you to check out my recently published in-depth article here: https://medium.com/@scourgedev/deep-dive-into-smart-contract-proxies-variants-create-vs-create2-and-security-considerations-7f3454d176a0

Thanks for reading! You can find me on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/0xScourgeDev

TLDR: Watch out for functions with names like superSafeFunction96508587, proxies that are not initialized properly, and implementation contracts that contain selfdestruct."

In this subreddit and on r/cryptocurrency, I've seen many posts about this question with the usual arguments regarding software and hardware wallets. While I can understand these arguments,  don't understand why well-established really good smart contract multi-signature wallets such as Gnosis Safe aren't ever recommended.

I mean, they have some unique advantages:

* use m/n logic to ensure, that only m signers can make transactions

* Signers can be software or hardware wallets ; both are possible, and as long as I use different wallets, it's unlikely that both will be hacked at the same time.

* Can be used with multiple keys for yourself to have DIY 2FA and backups. I use 2/4 with one key for laptop, one for smartphone (2FA), and two backup keys at home(+friends) in case I loose my laptop+phone at the same time.

* Easy key rolling. Lost laptop or compromised phone? No worries, I just replace the phone key with a new one.

* Gnosis Safe smart contract supports all DeFi, because it's literally a smart contract making tx for you. This is in contrast to hardware wallets which are typically last in queue to support DeFi.

* Multi-sig is implemented *on-chain*, instead in software. Some software wallets also have multiple-sig, but a bug in such large software is more likely that in concise smart contracts.

* Is heavily used by defi DAOs to manage treasurjes, etc.

* No single point of failure. Every wallet should have this, and only multi-sig wallets can actually achieve this.

And so on. As you see, such wallets can have many benefits, so I don't understand why they're rarely mentioned. The only problem I see, is that they're only on smart contract Blockchains. But since I almost only am in Ethereum ecosystem, this is fine.

What do you all think? Do you think multi-sig wallets are rightly underrated in such wallet discussions?"

It's amazing to acknowledge how quickly the developers have moved to make strides toward building a working solution. I'll share some of the information I've gathered along the way here.

**Here's a quick explanation of how ZK-Rollups work:**

* Zero-Knowledge Rollups is a protocol that scales the Ethereum Network by performing bundling and taking transaction data off the main blockchain, preventing Ethereum from becoming congested.
* ZK-Rollup works by taking hundreds of payments off-chain and mixing these into one transaction. The Ethereum Network then sends a SNARK to the main chain for verification.

As you may be aware, the first working solution (which is also EVM compatible) is Polygon's zkEVM. Not only does it use Zero-Knowledge Rollups to process transactions off the main chain (Ethereum, thus not congestion it), but it's also EVM-compatible, making deploying on zkEVM a breeze for smart contracts already deployed on EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.).

Now, projects whose smart contracts are already deployed on less-secure Layer2 blockchains can take advantage of the security benefits of Ethereum.

**Benefits of deploying smart contracts on zkEVM:**

* **Secure:** Transactions performed by smart contracts on the Polygon zkEVM can be reliably verified on Ethereum without nodes having to re-execute the operations (because of the ZK proofs).
* **Cheaper:** not compared to Polygon POS Chain, but to Ethereum, costs are cheaper while enjoying the same security of the battle-tested Ethereum Network. ZK-Rollups can afford to post minimal data to Ethereum because validity proofs already guarantee the trustworthiness of state transitions.
* **Faster Finality & Capital Efficiency**: transactions executed on Polygon zkEVM are finalized immediately after they are posted on Ethereum.
* **Network Effects:** being able to easily deploy smart contracts on multiple chains is insanely valuable for developers. Instead of having to spend time and effort adapting the same smart contract code to different chains, developers can now just take the same code and deploy it on zkEVM, enjoying all the benefits that come with it in a breeze.

As with any new chain, DeFi is a MUST to kick-start the on-chain activity and bring it to life. With zkEVM becoming very popular before launching, EVM-compatible protocols have already deployed on the chain, competing for TVL. While the current TVL on the chain is low, there are two current contenders:

1. Quickswap with $1.19M in TVL (DEX). Despite the relatively low TVL, Quickswap’s V3 comes with a unique Automated Market Maker called Concentrated Liquidity. This allows Liquidity Providers to supply liquidity within custom prices ranges, lowering fees and boosting volume. These prices ranges can also be automated thanks to the Gamma implementation.
2. 0vix with $667K in TVL (Lending). Lending and especially borrowing can be daunting. Thus 0vix has implemented a plethora of in-house developments to ensure that price volatility doesn’t get you by surprise. Quantitative in-house Risk Assessment Research, Dynamic Interest Rate Curve, Toxicity Numbers and 24 hours Liquidation Probability are just a few of the special features of 0vix. Ensure you give them a read to understand how they work, since it's a lot to go through.

While in its early stages, Zero-Knowledge Rollups technology has already made a big splash in the crypto space, and, apart from zkEVM, there is a bunch of other projects in the works:

* zkSync
* StarkNET
* Scroll

Some of the information in this post is taken from official documentation sources, while some of it is explained using my understanding. Please correct me if I'm wrong and share your knowledge as I would love to learn more about Zero-Knowledge Rollups and/or zkEVM."

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

But I've seen that the tx pool currently has more than 100k tk in mem-pool, even though it fluctuates only up to 150k. https://etherscan.io/chart/pendingtx

That means, that the majority of tx as sitting there and taking up space. If I submit lots of tx with low gas fee (e.g. 0.1 gwei base), then as an attacker I can throttle the ethereum network by requiring them to transmit and store these tx in memory. Surely, this isn't good, right? It wouldn't cost an attacker much to resubmit the tx regularly. Wir say just 0.25 ETH they could submit lots of pending txs.

Or does the protocol allow any node operator to simply and arbitrarily reject txs from other nodes and from users if the gas is half as big as the 7 day minimum?"
113,2023-04-16,"In the long run, what do you think is the soft supply floor that eth will converge on?",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12oebuv/in_the_long_run_what_do_you_think_is_the_soft/,2,"The PoS & burning mechanics make a very interesting and unique issuance[monetary]policy for eth that I've been thinking about a lot. The laws of supply and demand economics dictate that as supply falls and/or demand increases, the equilibrium price of a good must go up. So what does this mean? The way I'm working this out in my head is as follows:


&nbsp;

* eth supply is falling because burning > issuance. This by itself over a long enough timeline means price of eth must go up. And as eth price increases, so too does the cost of the avg network fees in gwei relative to usd. e.g 25 gwei gas fees at $1000 eth is not the same as 25 gwei gas fees at $2000 eth. 

* Given the same demand for blockspace, if the price of eth goes up, then the gas fees must come down eventually. We can visualize this by pretending that total supply of eth has burned its way down to 1 eth... you wouldn't expect avg gas fees to still be 25 gwei in this scenario right?

* Economists hate on deflation because it leads to a spiral where people stop spending which leads to lower production, lower prices, lower everything and economic activity grinds to crawl.  But if the gas fees come down enough due to a low utilization, you get to a point where issuance > burning and now total supply is starting to go back up again. It just seems to me that a deflationary spiral is just impossible on ethereum so the big contention of ""deflation bad"" rethoric that economists tend to argue is a non starter here? Would actually love to hear economists thoughts on this, am I missing something here?

* Curveball: meanwhile we also have 18m+ eth staked which reduces effective supply and impact prices and introduces a whole new dynamic to all of the points I made above. This is also an important number to think about in terms of where it will level off in the long run but I suspect this number will eventually be tethered to the Feds or rather the prevailing interest rates that exist at any given time as we begin to weigh staking apr against it.

&nbsp;

This is a very long winded way of asking in the long run where you think the general range of total eth supply will be dancing around based on adoption and usage trends that you see now?

&nbsp;

**tl:dr** - eth won't always have net burning because it gets harder as total effective supply goes down due to its supply/demand mechanics, where do you think the soft floor is in total eth supply where it becomes impossible to overcome the inflation from issuance?

&nbsp;

My answer is somewhere between 80-100m. My rationale is that I'm just guessing out my ass and that number ""feels right"". But really, the answer is based on what I believe the price of eth would be if supply fell to 80-100m and if at that range, the avg gas fees would be low enough to hit equilibrium issuance."

Ethereum is a well-established blockchain network that has gained significant traction and popularity within the cryptocurrency community. The Ethereum network has been instrumental in the growth and development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which has seen explosive growth in recent years. Many DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap, Aave, and MakerDAO, are built on the Ethereum network, demonstrating its usefulness and practicality.

and blah-blah-blah, but!

&#x200B;

* If you read the original whitepaper, you'll see that it was never really possible to build a network capable of enabling revolutionary decentralised applications. In reality, all smart contracts and applications either incorporate traditional banking methods for ether (what we now call DeFi, but which have long existed in traditional banks) or try to mimic traditional applications, but fail to achieve the same widespread adoption. **If I am wrong, please feel free to share examples in the comments section.**
* While the capitalisation of the network seems to grow due to the existing ""blockchain value"", newly minted cryptocurrencies or even identical NFTs are inflated by ""pseudo purchases"" with ether. In essence, what is the point of capitalisation if I keep investing the same currency in myself and artificially inflating my own value? **If I am wrong, please correct me.**
* Furthermore, all updates to the Ethereum network are strictly technical in nature, which brings technical solutions that are already available on other networks, but in principle does not offer any added value to network participants. **If I am wrong, please correct me.**"

However, if `X` knows, that they're operating a node. Now, `X` could take something that's illegal in most countries (child pornography for instance), compress and add it to the blockchain. (Edit: I mean this done undercover obviously or so.). While that would be an expensive one-time operation, `X` could then now go to the node operator and simply ask ""Do you have child pornography in your custody?"". This would be problematic. If the node operator says 'No.', then `X` can say, that they think that the node operator has copies of the blockchain data - and hence illegal content. If the `NO` says ""Yes"", then that's a reason for arrest.

The problem is, that this could be used as a general reason to arrest ANY node operator regardless of the actual motivation the actor X has. It doesn't matter. `X` can always say, that the NO has illegal blockchain data they're serving to the internet. And `X` would be always right and could prove that in front of court. Also, it doesn't matter who uploads such data in the first place. If the data exists on-chain, it can be used for a legal attack.

Transient Storage creates a place in a block with temporary data for Ethereum transactions. The benefits are significant gas savings for users, for rollups, and in making certain aspects of smart contracts more secure. We often take for granted the permanence of data on the blockchain, but there is value in being able to store temporary data too.

&#x200B;

# Contract Storage on Ethereum

Whenever a smart contract is deployed to Ethereum, it receives an amount of storage that it can use to hold data. This storage contains everything a contract may need; whitelisted addresses, who the contract owner is, what the balances of token holders are, and so on.

When one of these pieces of data needs to be updated, like changing the owner of a contract for example, a transaction is submitted with the old owner’s address as well as the new owner’s. This rewrites the data held in contract storage, and a record of the old contract owner is maintained in the transaction history.

The problem is that this operation of writing or rewriting data to the blockchain is the most expensive operation that can be performed (it involves updating Ethereum’s state trie, which you can [read about here](https://ramiwrites.substack.com/p/merkle-trees-how-blockchain-data)). Despite the cost, this operation happens frequently out of necessity. 

&#x200B;

# Memory Storage

If a contract’s storage is the hard drive, you can think of memory storage as the RAM. Memory storage is where a contract stores the data it actually uses when performing a transaction (retrieving the old contract owner’s name and updating it with the new one, for example). Once a transaction is finalized, any relevant new values in memory storage are posted or updated in contract storage, i.e. the expensive transaction. Everything that shouldn’t be posted to contract storage is deleted.

https://preview.redd.it/1bl3ma52avta1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=83179d256f75a3ed4b9b46f0b63d8d6c8fdc00b3

One might wonder if memory storage is sufficient to allow “transient storage,” a place for temporary data to exist for the duration of a transaction. This suspicion is somewhat correct, and there are some implementations of transient storage on Ethereum today that do things this way. There are however limitations to using memory storage as a temporary data source that necessitate transient storage as a new feature.

&#x200B;

# EIP-1153: Transient Storage

EIP-1153 creates a new space in blocks to hold data temporarily while a transaction is executed. This approach to transient storage delivers several benefits that are explained below, including cheaper deployment of some contracts, cheaper costs for rollups reporting their state to Ethereum, and protection from re-entrancy attacks.

https://preview.redd.it/ahk2ntu3avta1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c7e899d53c5cff526d57ab6977a9d5e30dbf416c

&#x200B;

# Cheaper Contract Deployment

Many contracts today allow users to create completely new contracts, as in Uniswap when creating a new liquidity pool to swap two assets, or when setting up a new NFT contract with Manifold. When users use Uniswap or Manifold for this purpose, the contract they interact with “initializes” the new contract with some basic parameters. To do this it’ll have some generic data like the structure of the liquidity pool, or code compliant to the standard of ERC-721. Alongside the generic data there’ll also be some individual data that describes the specific assets in a pool or the fee it charges for trades, or the name of an NFT smart contract.

EIP-1153 enables the generic data (init code) to always stay the same by instead passing the individual data (constructor arguments) into transient storage. This method saves gas costs on deployments of these types of contracts since individual data is not posted on-chain.

&#x200B;

# Rollup Storage

Rollups aggregate transactions and submit them together to Ethereum in batches. When rollups submit to Ethereum, they submit the proof (the result of all the transactions), as well as the data executed itself. The data is published so that the proof can be verified as valid.

Transient storage can allow rollups to generate their proofs more efficiently. This reduces gas costs for all rollup submissions, and by extension, all transactions on rollups.

https://preview.redd.it/6x9aw4d5avta1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a138a7e3623441739c78453cefe95d503347946

&#x200B;

# Re-Entrancy Attacks

A re-entrancy attack happens when a transaction is able to withdraw assets from a contract multiple times before stopping, often draining a contract of its funds. This happens when a vulnerable contract sends assets out first, then updates its balance afterwards. A re-entrancy attack gets in the middle of those two actions, preventing the vulnerable contract from updating its balance and allowing the attacker to drain it of its funds.

Re-entrancy attacks can be prevented with properly planned code, but transient storage makes them even easier to mitigate. By storing information about a withdrawal in transient storage, withdrawals will happen only for pre-determined amounts.

&#x200B;

# In Conclusion

Transient storage can reduce gas costs across a variety of complex smart contracts. This enables using dApps more cost-effectively while also enabling novel applications on Ethereum. Someone has already [developed a way](https://hackmd.io/@7-EMZFyUQNeY0Ttk6APiXA/r1rHOZ8mo#) to give someone a quick, instant loan while keeping custody of the funds.

While transient storage benefits users, the bigger benefit is to the protocols that use it. Uniswap and Optimism have pushed aggressively for transient storage to be included in the Shanghai upgrade instead of staking withdrawals. The controversy around that motivated me to start this newsletter to keep people informed on developments in Ethereum. My hope is this information enables people to understand where Ethereum is going, and to add your voice on where you think that should be.

The recent case of leaked Pentagon documents on Discord, which went undetected for weeks, is misused by the Biden administration to consider expanding its monitoring of social media activities and chat rooms (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-intel-agencies-missed-classified-documents-leaked-on-discord-rcna79404). In the case of the leaked Pentagon documents, the intelligence community's desire to prevent future leaks may result in the adoption of invasive surveillance methods. This move raises again important questions about the balance between security and our civil liberties, and it highlights the crucial role that cryptography and cryptocurrencies (e.g. tech like VPNs or Tornado Cash and projects like Monero) play in preserving our privacy.

The US 1st Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and the press, among other rights. Yet, the government's attempts to monitor online platforms and private chatrooms will erode these freedoms. Although public chatrooms may be considered fair game, law enforcement agencies actually do not have the legal authority to monitor private online chatrooms without a probable cause. Expanding surveillance efforts - e.g. under the guise of national security (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-idUSBRE95910O20130612) - would inevitably risk violating these legal safeguards. The government seems striving to monitor not only our money and spending/saving (with CBDCs and social credit systems) but also wants to follow us on every step online going forward and being able to quickly censor if needed (e.g. https://nclalegal.org/2023/01/the-white-house-covid-censorship-machine/)

Cryptography and cryptocurrencies offer us some tooling to protect our privacy from the ever increasing, invasive government surveillance. By using encryption tools to secure data and communications like VPNs, we can shield our online activities from prying eyes, maintaining control over oit personal information. Similarly, our dear cryptocurrencies provide a level of financial privacy and autonomy that traditional banking systems cannot offer and CBDCs never will. It is clear that the governments have no interest in the proliferation and wide-scale use of these technologies by retail, so we observe hidden and increasingly visible attacks focusing on them as demonstrated with: the Tornado Cash case (https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/26/tornado-cash-sanctions-by-us-treasury-draw-outrage-suits-from-crypto-community), attacks on privacy coins (https://www.thestreet.com/crypto/news/dubai-bans-all-privacy-coins), attacks on VPNs via the RESTRICT act (https://reason.com/2023/03/29/could-the-restrict-act-criminalize-the-use-of-vpns/) and attenpts to install chat controls (https://www.change.org/p/european-parliament-defend-our-privacy-vote-no-to-chat-control).

Therefore, I can only urge everyone to stay vigilant, push back surveillance agendas and educate as much people as possible about the importance of cash, cryptocurrencies and cryptography as well as the overreach of our governments. //Rant over

————————

TL;DR: 
The governments’ increasing tendency to expand its surveillance capabilities in the name of national security is a concerning development that poses a threat. The 1st Amendment and the legal safeguards designed to protect civil liberties must be upheld, and the use of cryptography and cryptocurrencies is crucial in preserving our privacy in an increasingly monitored environment!"

148,2023-04-13,PSA: Moving crypto between wallets is not taxable!,114,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12kye2c/psa_moving_crypto_between_wallets_is_not_taxable/,51,"Hey everyone! Earlier this week, I made a post on taxes and someone asked me whether transferring crypto between wallets is taxable. I wanted to write up a longer post to explain the tax implications of wallet-to-wallet transfers in the US. 

The short answer is that moving crypto between wallets you own is NOT TAXABLE.

However, it’s still important to keep records of your wallet-to-wallet transfers for tax purposes. 

**Why you should keep records of wallet transfers**

Keeping complete records of crypto transactions will make it easier to calculate your capital gains and losses after a wallet-to-wallet transfer.

To better understand why this is important, consider the following scenario.

You buy $10,000 of ETH on Coinbase.

You transfer your crypto to a cold wallet.

You sell $15,000 of ETH on Gemini.

In this case, your capital gain should be $5,000. However, if you haven’t kept records of your capital gains and losses, you’ll be forced to recognize the entire $15,000 proceeds of your sale as a capital gain.

**What should I do if I haven’t been keeping records?**

If you haven’t been keeping records of your wallet-to-wallet transfers, don’t worry. You can look through your transaction history on your exchanges and wallets to find the price of your crypto at receipt and disposal — this will make it easier to calculate capital gains and losses.

If you’re having trouble with this or you just have a fuckton of transactions, you can use crypto tax software (like [CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), CoinTracker, or whatever other option you choose) to calculate your gains and losses across all your wallets and exchanges.

**Hey man, I tried crypto tax software and now I have a missing cost basis error!**

Many investors who use multiple wallets get a ‘missing cost basis’ error from their crypto tax platforms.

There are a few different reasons why you might get this error, but usually this happens when you’ve transferred your cryptocurrency between wallets and you haven’t connected all of your wallets and exchanges to the platform!

To calculate your capital gains, the crypto tax software you’re using needs to know your original cost basis for acquiring your crypto. That means you need to add all of your wallets and exchanges to the platform — even exchanges that you haven’t used in years. This way, the platform will have access to your complete transaction history.

**TL;DR:** Wallet-to-wallet transfers aren’t taxable, but they can fuck up reporting your taxes if you haven’t kept careful records."

Because it’s just code it’s at best pseudorandom and if the 32 validators work together they can heavily influence who the next validators are. Pseudorandom number generators vs truly random number generators( PRNG vs TRNG) is a topic that has been studied in cryptography for a long time and it is known that software alone cannot be truly random. Isn’t this a security concern?  I believe that there are plans implement hardware devices for “verifiable delay functions” which just introduces mining hardware back into the protocol. The whole point of proof of stake is that you don’t require hardware running that’s just using electricity. It’s essentially using a variant of proof of work to seed the randomness.

I've been working on a POC app for securely sharing encrypted info between parties (P2P) on EVM-based networks. It involves users with EOAs generating public-private key pairs using the secp256k1 elliptic curve. Here's a quick rundown of the process:  


1. User 1 encrypts a message with User 2's public key, ensuring only User 2 can decrypt it.
2. User 1 signs the encrypted message, allowing User 2 to verify its authenticity.
3. User 1 submits a transaction containing the encrypted & signed message to the network.
4. The transaction is processed, triggering an event. Anyone can listen, but only User 2 can decrypt the data.
5. User 2 decrypts the message and reads its content.

Since the app's target users might not be tech-savvy and could lose their private keys, I've been looking into EIP-4377 and smart contract wallets. They seem more practical, using the CREATE2 opcode and contract parking (like domain parking).

I'm seeking advice on how to best use smart contract wallets for sharing info between users in this context. Also, I'd appreciate any tips on handling key recovery, especially regarding social recovery methods.

161,2023-04-13,Exploring the Benefits of Account Abstraction on Ethereum,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12kf9tx/exploring_the_benefits_of_account_abstraction_on/,7,"On Ethereum, transactions can only be initiated by externally owned accounts (EOAs) like Metamask, while contract accounts can implement arbitrary logic. However, for some use-cases like smart-contract wallets or privacy protocols, this difference can create a lot of friction.

This is where account abstraction comes in, allowing users to use smart contract wallets instead of EOAs. This removes the need for users to use EOAs in order to perform transactions.  But what do contract accounts do that EOAs can't? Smart contracts are infinitely more flexible in their capabilities than EOAs. Each smart contract can define different rules and configurations within its code.

Currently, Ethereum users need an EOA with gas or rely on wallet providers to facilitate meta-transactions through relays. Relying on the wallet provider creates a lot of friction, and using an EOA with gas means buying ETH from centralized exchanges after KYC. RAILGUN is an already-deployed ZK account abstraction implementation that uses relayers, and these transactions are by definition meta-transactions.

Account abstraction would allow smart contract wallets to accept gasless meta-transactions from users and pay for their gas without relying on the relay network. This base-layer capability would dramatically boost the UX onboarding of such wallets without losing the decentralization assurances of Ethereum."

The coupling of digital IDs with CBDCs could allow governments to monitor transactions, exerting control over citizens' finances (https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uwRSzNTp2ko). This integration may lead to social credit systems, where user behaviors are tracked, profiled, and rewarded or punished, undermining privacy, autonomy, and human dignity. It goes without saying that the current war against cryptocurrencies in the US and Canada is likely related to those developments.

As such, it is crucial to remain vigilant and prevent digital IDs from becoming tools for excessive control and a reality at all before it is too late. Continue using cash, keep your cryptocurrencies tight and push back against any agenda, which appear to be Trojan horses to undermine our democratic system (incl. RESTRICT act: https://www.coincenter.org/the-restrict-act-creates-blanket-authority-with-few-checks-to-ban-just-about-anything-linked-to-a-foreign-adversary/)!

————————————-

TL;DR: The US and the EU are pushing digital ID systems, which may provide the way for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and social credit systems similar to China. These systems could undermine privacy, autonomy, and human dignity, enabling government surveillance and control. To protect democracy, we must stay vigilant, use cash, secure our cryptocurrencies, and resist agendas that threaten our freedom."

167,2023-04-13,The Uncertainty Principle and Decentralization,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12ku2up/the_uncertainty_principle_and_decentralization/,1,"I keep seeing people ask what's next after Shapella. Besides the current protocol state, how can we possibly know ""what's next"" for a decentralized network, especially when such an event is so far in the future? To me events like these upgrades imply the existence of, metaphorically speaking, a 'core' or very dense 'center of mass' to the network.

In physics there's a principle used to describe the fundamental unpredictability of reality, i.e. The Uncertainty Principle. In a philosophical sense, it's a mathematical way of saying there is no conceivable means of being in control of the universe, because any controller comes from the universe and is therefore bound by it.

Put simply, the more information you have about where any particle in the universe going, the less info you have about its location, and conversely the more you know about location, the less you know about where it's going. In other words, the universe cannot be said to be 'centralized', because IF we could lock in both pieces of information about the universe at ANY point in space or time, THEN we could predict the future with increasing certainty. This is ruled impossible (with 100% confidence) by the Uncertainty Principle.

To me, this is in many ways a foundational principle behind the IDEAL of decentralization in crypto. No small entity *should* be able to know about the STATE of the network and its DIRECTION at the same time. To be incapable of that IS TO BE decentralized, and the converse is also true.

The upgrade roadmaps seem to run counter to this, expressing to know both status AND direction.

If this resonates with anyone, I'd love to know your thoughts. Please educate me!"

1. Increased liquidity: Flash minting allows users to borrow assets they need for immediate use without having to lock up their own collateral. This can increase liquidity in the system and make it easier for users to access the assets they need.
2. More efficient arbitrage: Flash minting can allow arbitrageurs to quickly and efficiently take advantage of price discrepancies between different markets. This can lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and better price discovery.
3. Better risk management: By allowing users to borrow assets for immediate use, flash minting can help mitigate some of the risks associated with holding large amounts of collateral. This can make the system more stable and less susceptible to cascading liquidations.
4. Innovation: Flash minting can provide a powerful building block for new types of financial applications and smart contracts. It can enable new forms of financial experimentation that were previously not possible.

Overall, the addition of ETH flash mint EVM instructions can unlock new possibilities for the Ethereum ecosystem and bring significant benefits to users and developers. It is a good idea to explore this proposal further and consider its potential implications."

**Thoughts**:

While there may not be anything particularly striking, Tracing back the origins of Ethereum and witnessing its evolution over time is truly remarkable. What started as humble beginnings in 2013 with the creation of the first repositories has now transformed into a revolutionary platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Delving into the early stages of development provides invaluable insights into the immense hard work and dedication that has gone into building the Ethereum ecosystem we know and rely on today.

Staking rewards are taxable income and need to be reported at fair market value upon receipt. Reporting rewards while still locked has benefits such as potentially lower tax rates for long-term gains.

Those using Coinbase should be aware of a possible tax mistake. When you stake ETH on Coinbase, your rewards are reported on Form 1099-MISC, which is issued annually by Coinbase. This indicates that your rewards were reported to the IRS as taxable income at the time they were earned, even if they were locked up. When you provide ETH to Coinbase for staking, they ""convert"" it to ETH2 and classify it as a taxable event. When Coinbase distributes staking rewards to users after the Shanghai upgrade, they might ""convert""and label this as a taxable event.

If you have any questions, make sure to reach out to a tax professional!

When I look in the console on my dev environment localhost, I see a few different rpc calls when I connect. One to get the wallet balance, one to tell the user how many nfts have already been minted and then when they mint one to call the contract mint function. Since it’s a dev environment I think there is some duplication in these, so maybe 5 rpc calls per user? 

When I look at Infuras free tier you get 100k calls a day for free. I could also upgrade to 200k rpc calls a day for $50/month. 

Given I only have about 5000 nft tokens, I can’t see me needing more than 5000 x 5 calls = 25k calls on mint day. 

With this in mind would the free Infura rpc tier be ok or should I definitely upgrade for speed/other reason ?

Before we get started I do want to share a disclaimer that I’m just some guy on Reddit and you should definitely do your own research before making any kind of tax or financial decision. 

**Do I really need to report my taxes?** 

Reporting your taxes is the safe move if you use centralized exchanges and want to avoid trouble from the IRS in the future. 

If you’re using a major exchange like Coinbase or Kraken, you should remember that you gave away all your personal information during the signup process. These platforms send 1099 forms to the IRS and have in the past shared customer information with the federal government after being served a John Doe Summons. 

**Do I still need to report taxes if I lost money on crypto?** 

If you realized a loss on crypto in 2022, you can actually save money on your taxes. Capital losses can offset gains and up to $3,000 of income. 

**What info do I need to report my taxes?** 

You need the following information on each of your crypto transactions to accurately report your capital gains and losses. 

* The type of cryptocurrency 
* The amount of crypto involved in the transaction
* The price of crypto at time of receipt
* The price of crypto at the time of disposal 
* The date you received your crypto 
* The date you disposed of your crypto 

Collecting this information can be tough if you’ve used decentralized wallets like MetaMask during the year. In this case, you might want to use crypto tax software (more on this later). 

**Should I file an extension?** 

If you haven’t made any efforts to file your taxes yet and you’re panicking, filing an extension might be the best move. 

To file for a tax extension, you should fill out Form 4868 before the tax deadline. This way, you’ll have until October 16 to file your taxes. 

You can [submit this form online](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/extension-of-time-to-file-your-tax-return). 

It’s important to remember that you’re still required to make a tax payment by April 18th *even if* you file for an extension (it’s the IRS, did you think they were going to be cool about it?). If you overpay, the IRS will send you your money back. If you underpay, you’ll owe the IRS your shortfall (plus interest and penalties). 

It’s also important to remember that you shouldn’t procrastinate even if you file for an extension. You should get started getting a record of your transactions so that you’ll be fine once it’s October. 

**Do I need crypto tax software?** 

Honestly, you probably don’t need crypto tax software if you only have a few transactions for the year or you only used one exchange the entire year. However, things get complicated when you have multiple transactions across multiple exchanges. 

For example, if you transferred your crypto from Coinbase to Gemini or from Coinbase to MetaMask, it may be hard to keep track of your capital gains and losses. In this case, the tax forms you get from your exchange won’t help you file your taxes (remember, they only have information on transactions that take place on their platform). 

In cases like these, you might want to get started with crypto tax software that can integrate with your wallets and exchanges and pull the information you need to file your taxes automatically. There are tons of good options out there ([CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), CoinTracker, and many more). 

Thanks for reading y’all! Hope this is helpful."

200,2023-04-11,How do I make an ERC721 NFT contract that only accepts mint function calls from a specific domain?,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12i5qbp/how_do_i_make_an_erc721_nft_contract_that_only/,23,"Hey guys, I'm trying to build a domain locked NFT minting smart contract. I have been doing whitelisted nft mints to prevent botting attacks, but those are tedious. Nobody wants to participate in my whitelisted mints because they're such a pain in the a\*\*. I have to give the minters time to give me their Ethereum addresses so I can add them to the whitelist to make the merkle root and that takes a really long time. Plus if you miss the whitelisting you can't get one. Once I deploy the merkle root, anyone who never gave me their Ethereum wallet can't mint the NFT.

So I've concluded that I have to mint from a website protected with a captcha. This is really hard because people can just write scripts/bots that call the contract directly.  

My 2 plans of attack are:  

* I could incorporate some type of CORS policy in the solidity contract that only allows minting function calls from the actual domain of my minting site... Does something like that exist. ?
* I could make a proxy contract that does all of the minting and my captcha webpage uses this proxy contract to call the NFT contract, mint an NFT, and sends it to the person trying to claim an NFT. The biggest problems that I have with this are that:
   * I think I will have to pay the gas fees for my proxy contract to mint and send the NFT. I don't know if there's a way around this. 
   * Also I will have to expose my proxy contract owner's private key in my website deployment. This means the website can't be static, not to mention keeping a private key on a server is a security vulnerability.

P.S. I want this site to be static if possible because I want to use a Handshake domain.

Does anyone know how I should procede? Is there a third option that I'm missing?"
201,2023-04-10,Ushering in a New Era: How GPT DAOs Will Enable AI Autonomy Using Ethereum,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12htsl1/ushering_in_a_new_era_how_gpt_daos_will_enable_ai/,14,"I recently had an idea that I think will interest people, which combines the power of AI and Ethereum in a way that could reshape the landscape of both fields. I propose the GPT DAO, designed to generate income for node operators through various online income streams.


What is the GPT DAO?

The GPT DAO is a theoretical Decentralized Autonomous Organization that brings together GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models to create a decentralized network of AI nodes. Each GPT node would act as an individual decision-maker within the DAO. Node operators could contribute their hardware resources, such as processing power and storage, and be rewarded with Ethereum for their participation.

The primary purpose of the DAO would be to autonomously generate income for node operators through online activities like freelance work, trading, article writing, and more. By harnessing the power of AI, the GPT DAO could participate in various income-generating tasks and distribute the earnings to node operators.


How would it work?

- Pre-trained GPT: The foundation would be a pre-trained GPT model, capable of understanding and generating human-like text.

- Node software: Individuals could become node operators, contributing their hardware resources (storage and processing power) and earning cryptocurrency in return.

- Distributed storage & processing: GPT models would be stored and run on nodes using distributed file systems and parallel processing frameworks.

- Consensus mechanism: A consensus algorithm would ensure consistency and agreement across the GPT nodes.

- Cryptocurrency rewards: Node operators would be rewarded with cryptocurrency for providing storage and processing power using the income generated by the DAO's online activities.

- Smart contracts: Smart contracts could facilitate interactions between GPT nodes, manage task distribution and rewards, and handle other DAO operations.

- DAO governance: GPT nodes would participate in a voting system, making decisions as individual entities within the DAO, including selecting and prioritizing income-generating tasks.


Why should this idea interest the Ethereum community?

This innovative concept brings together AI and blockchain in a unique way. The GPT DAO has the potential to:

- Democratize access to AI technology and enable new use cases, such as online income generation.

- Reward users for their contributions with Ethereum, fostering a true sharing economy.

- Decentralize AI processing, mitigating the risks associated with centralized control.

- Benefit from the expertise of the cryptocurrency community to drive innovation in both AI and blockchain technologies.


I'm sharing this idea to see what you all think and to spark a discussion about the possibilities and challenges of such a concept, particularly in terms of income generation for node operators.

What do you think? Are you intrigued by the idea of merging AI and crypto to generate income for node operators? I would love to hear your thoughts on the subject."

Turns out it was way more than I thought.

Can I still withdraw that?

The wallet I used was a mist ""contract wallet"". I have the key of the account that controls it.

I found the withdraw contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0xbf4ed7b27f1d666546e30d74d50d173d20bca754#code), but I don't know how to call the withdraw() function ""from"" my ""wallet contract"". In fact I don't even know how to import that ""contract wallet"" into metamask or MEW or anywhere else (I can import the controlling account into both).

Are these wallet contracts still a thing?

Any help appreciated.

I will be generous to anyone who helps me substantially in recovering the funds.

UPDATE:

MAJOR SUCCESS: I managed to transfer the DAO from that dreaded legacy mist contract wallet to a ""normal"" account based wallet by calling the wallet contracts execute() function instructing it to call theDAO transfer() function. 

I haven't redeemed to ETH yet because I'm considering to sell some DAO to those who are collecting.

I had tried to use the withdrawDAO's witdhraw() function (after approve()ing with theDAO first, which worked with enough gas), but this persistently failed ([out of gas], [invalid jump destination] while still eating a lot of fees. It's not clear to my why.

UPDATE2:

So I withdrew the largest part of the DAO to ETH now. I have some DAO left to sell if anyone wants some?

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

The ceremony involved signing all withdrawal credential messages, from 0x00 to 0x01, and these messages are now ready to be broadcasted to the Ethereum network after the Shapella hard fork on April 12th.  


With Ethereum withdrawals on the horizon, these credentials need to be rotated from 0x00 to 0x01, as the former must be migrated to the latter before partial and full withdrawals can be completed. This rotation is enabled by the Shapella hard fork.  


This was the first news I ran across today, second one was this strange Twitter acc [3ST](https://twitter.com/3SToken), dunno what to think, so because of my curiosity I needed to share it with you guys to see does anyone know what's that about.   


As I read the first rotation message was successfully signed and verified by a node 2.5 weeks ago, and as of last Friday, all 18,632 messages have been signed and validated. However, the messages will only be broadcasted to the network after the Shapella hard fork, meaning that the rotations will not occur until after the fork is live.

Many believe that large-scale ticketing giants have held a monopoly on event hosting for the world’s crème de la crème. But I think the only answer to all issues related to tickets is NFTs.  


The issues with the global ticketing industry are well-documented at this point. Bot-based tech has us fighting due to dynamic pricing and getting into a mode of panic buying. Then there are hidden fees, queues and scams, scalping, counterfeiting, pricing wars in the resale market, and more. We can agree that it’s unfair and unethical. The industry’s in desperate need of more transparency and authenticity.  


NFTs have the potential to change the ticketing game forever, I even bought one NFT ticket last year for a music festival. I've seen on ReelStar how artists may benefit thanks to NFTs, so NFT ticketing is just another plus for them.   


NFT ticketing could provide a more flexible and customizable ticketing experience for fans. For example, event organizers could create special NFT tickets for VIP experiences or exclusive events, or allow fans to purchase collectible NFT tickets that could increase in value over time.

244,2023-04-06,Why you should report your 2022 crypto losses on your taxes (you can save a ton of money),42,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12dp6os/why_you_should_report_your_2022_crypto_losses_on/,15,"*‘I don’t need to report crypto on my taxes because I didn’t take profits last year.’* 

I hear this pretty often both IRL and on Reddit, and it’s important to remember that this statement is a bit of an oversimplification.

It’s true that you don’t need to pay capital gains tax if you didn’t realize gains on crypto. However, reporting your cryptocurrency losses can help you save a ton of money in taxes. 

*(Disclaimer: I’m not a tax professional and you should do your own research before you sell your crypto/file your taxes. )*

**What’s the benefit of reporting crypto losses?** 

When you realize losses in crypto, you can offset capital gains from cryptocurrency, stocks, and other assets as well as up to $3,000 of income for the year! If you have a net loss for the year, you can even offset capital gains in future years. 

Let’s say you lost $100,000 in 2022 (I really hope this didn’t happen to anyone reading this). In this case, you can write off $3,000 of income this year and carry forward $97,000 of loss to write off gains in future years! This can save you a HUGE amount in taxes if you end up taking profits during the next bull run. 

**What do you mean by ‘realized’ loss?** 

A ‘realized’ loss basically just means you disposed of your cryptocurrency for a lower price than it was when you originally acquired it. 

Examples of disposals include selling your cryptocurrency, trading it for another crypto, or using your cryptocurrency to make a purchase. 

If you just held your cryptocurrency for all of last year, you didn’t ‘realize’ a loss. Unfortunately, that means you can’t write off your loss on your tax return. 

**‘But, reporting my crypto losses sounds like way too much work!’** 

There’s no reason not to report your capital losses on your taxes. If you’re using a crypto tax platform (like [CoinLedger](https://coinledger.io/), Koinly, CoinTracker, or whatever else is out there now), it should only take a few minutes. All you need to do is connect your wallets and exchanges and let the platform do the work for you. 

**TL;DR**: Reporting your crypto losses can help you save money on your tax bill."

* The Shanghai hardfork is scheduled for next week and will enable Ethereum validators to withdraw their staked ETH and rewards.
* Validators have staked over 18M ETH (\~$32B) in the deposit-only staking system.
* Staking rewards (partial withdrawals) will be automatically available after the hardfork, while full withdrawals (staking rewards + 32 ETH) will have stricter rate-limiting rules.
* Shanghai may increase the amount of ETH staked due to the reduced duration risk of staking.
* Liquid staking protocols like Lido and centralized exchanges like Coinbase will still be relevant, helping investors bypass the 32 ETH staking requirement.
* The hardfork marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's history as it completes its transition to proof-of-stake.

After the Shanghai upgrade completes, consider...

* Monitoring the **market impact of unlocked ETH and rewards**.
* Evaluating staking opportunities, as the hardfork may increase the amount of ETH staked.
* Keeping an eye on liquid staking protocols and centralized exchanges that could benefit from increased staking activity."

That’s why  I think it great how some NFT enthusiasts are turning to Layer 2 solutions, such as ZKSync, that offer faster and cheaper transactions without compromising on security or decentralization.  


Have you ever bought NFTs on the ZKSync Chain?  


I personally didn't since I don't buy 'em so much, I'm mostly on ReelStar, but I know tons of people who actually did that.   


ZKSync also supports smart contracts, which enable more complex and interactive NFT applications.

258,2023-04-05,About hardware wallets,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/12c7xvm/about_hardware_wallets/,24,"I saw a few threads about hardware and paper wallets, but I didn't find what I was looking for.

Some people claim that paper wallets are better than hardware wallets, but then how do they sign transactions? By hand?

The main benefit of a hardware wallet is that the transaction is signed INSIDE the hardware wallet and the private keys never leave it.

As soon as you send a private key to your mobile phone or computer, malware can steal it.

Of course, hardware wallets can be stolen and pins (even long-ish ones) can be recovered with enough computing power (gpu clusters) and specialized tools.

The most secure way would be to use a blank hardware wallet and reinitialize it each time with the seed phrase. No one can recover a seed phrase.

Anyway, my main concern is the following. Hardware wallets can't connect directly to the internet and are also usually connected to software wallets such as MetaMask. They receive transactions, sign them using the private key, and return the signed transactions.

The problem is that some malware is able to intercept and alter the transactions right before they reach the hardware wallet. Unless the hardware wallet shows the transaction data, including the calldata, there's no way to be sure we signed the correct transaction *before* sending it to the blockchain. Once we read it in the mempool or in a block, it's already too late!

**Question:** *do you know of any hardware wallet that shows, on its own display, both the destination address and the calldata of the transactions it's about to sign? [and ask for a confirmation, of course]*"

By leveraging blockchain technology, it's possible to create decentralized gaming platforms that are free from the centralized control of big gaming companies.

We can notice the beginnings of this right now, with many new projects basing the worth of their cryptocurrency and NFTs on Ethereum, while developing separate, decentralized ecosystems. This means that each of these projects will have its own independent and transparent financial system, instead of relying on the centralized one mainly controlled by the big players. If we add smart contracts that would ground the worth of people's investments in Ethereum, I believe the result would be a more fair and transparent gaming ecosystem with equal opportunities for everyone - both developers and players.

Some Ethereum-based projects that are going in the right direction and that may revolutionize the way we understand gaming in general (and perhaps destroy the dogma that gaming is ""a waste of time"" by allowing people to build an income by playing games) are NFT City Miner,  Aavegotchi, and The Sandbox. I can't wait to see what the future brings for them, and for crypto gaming in general.

BUT hold on tight, you need to keep in mind: tax implications for staked crypto. Here is a breakdown of what you need to know:

Staking rewards are considered taxable income and are taxed as ordinary income at the time of receipt. However, in the case of locked Ethereum, the time of receipt is a gray area.

Regardless, it's essential to report the fair market value of the cryptocurrency at the time of receipt, considering the continuous fluctuation of ETH's value.

The moment you have dominion and control over the token, the cryptocurrency is deemed ""received."" However, since Ethereum 2.0 has been locked, it's possible to argue that you had no dominion and control over your staking rewards until they were unlocked.

Reporting your rewards while they're still locked comes with several benefits. Firstly, the value of ETH could increase after the Shanghai upgrade, potentially raising the amount of taxable income you'll need to claim. Secondly, selling, converting, or disposing of your ETH creates a capital gain or loss. Holding onto the asset for more than a year qualifies as a long-term gain, which comes with more favorable tax rates.

One of the simplest methods to get these unique digital assets without having cryptocurrencies is to buy NFTs with a credit card. Some NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Nifty Gateway, let customers use credit cards to purchase nonfungible tokens. It is crucial to remember that not all marketplaces accept credit cards as a form of payment.  


Users must register for an account on the marketplace they want to use to purchase NFTs with a credit card. Before customers can use a credit card to purchase nonfungible tokens on some marketplaces, identity verification is required. Users can browse the various NFTs and choose the ones they want to buy after creating and verifying their accounts.  


I'm for now interested mostly in ReelStar, I'll need to check my payment options there.   


Another way is using a peer-to-peer exchange which allows users to buy and sell NFTs directly with each other without the need for intermediaries such as banks or payment processors.   


What I didn't understand is how you use third-party services to buy NFTs. What are the third-party services for NFTs?   


But what I heard is that the inability to purchase NFTs without crypto may also be hampered by high transaction costs and security issues."

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Edit2: Not sure how this community is so toxic. Some of you are just clearly here to step down on others. Let me tell you that it doesn't make you any better or smarter or superior.  For those that are helping, thank you!

Edit2: For those late to the party, is possible that my extensions got hacked and so on. Here are few lessons from all this:
- Use Safer, Exodus or Electrum wallets.
- Could've been this - https://securityscorecard.com/research/detailed-analysis-redline-stealer/
- Also don't save your secret pass phrase online AT ALL, the world has evolve and targeting crypto is as common as it gets. It will detect, it will find, you will lose. (Like me)
- Use Cold wallet if u can afford it.
- Love to everyone and good luck!

For example, I assume diversifying the current client distribution would be one aspect that would be important.

305,2023-03-31,Gas Fees: Ethereum's Ultimate Defense - A Simple Explanation,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/127p303/gas_fees_ethereums_ultimate_defense_a_simple/,3,"# Introduction

https://preview.redd.it/yey8igqde3ra1.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=78100fa2e67a61afb49cd82c700cbe8447398a64

Validators execute transactions in a block, and compute the resulting changes to the network. Transactions in blocks have fees associated with them, called gas fees, that serve as a defense mechanism protecting blockchains from attack. 

&#x200B;

# The Halting Problem

Let’s start with an old computer science problem solved by Alan Turing himself; The Halting Problem. The Halting Problem says that the only way to find out if a program will halt execution at some point (as it should), is to execute that program. There is no way to determine if there will be a result without working to compute that result. This simple discovery is the essence for why gas exists on Ethereum.

&#x200B;

# Why Blockchains Have Gas Fees

Blockchains must always be operational, which requires miners/validators to continuously execute transactions. These transactions are broadcast in programming languages like Solidity or the lower-level bytecode, which means that transactions are themselves programs. Validators execute transactions and compute the changes our transactions have on the network, but remember the Halting Problem here. A malicious person could send a transaction that never halts, keeps looping, and drains validator resources. Gas serves as the protection against this behavior.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0c6qcybqd3ra1.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf372764f47322fc0ade98891c0a3e5e02f794c9

When we send transactions, we must associate them with gas fees we’re willing to pay. This gas cost covers the resources used to compute our transaction - but is also a limit on the resources the transaction can take. If a transaction runs out of gas, execution stops and the transaction is discarded. This is far better than having transactions stuck in loops, draining resources.

&#x200B;

# Gas Limit

Gas is measured in units. Each operation that can be performed requires units of gas based on how much effort it requires. Complex transactions like deploying a smart contract or minting an NFT require more effort to compute than a simple transfer of currency. The difference of effort is measured in the different units of gas required.

The units of gas used by a transaction is expressed in its gas limit. The higher the gas limit, the more effort validators can spend executing it. If a transaction requires more effort to execute than the gas allocated to it, the transaction will fail. When transactions fail due to this “out of gas” error, validators stop executing them and keep the gas for the effort they already spent.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wjhul39le3ra1.jpg?width=650&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eba284cbd60ca1bba13f801cd5b529f86e2d1060

The gas limit prevents blockchains from experiencing the Halting Problem. No transaction can execute indefinitely unless it also has an indefinite amount of gas associated. This in unrealistically expensive, especially since as we will see next, gas costs money.

&#x200B;

# Gas Price

he cost of each unit of gas is measured in sub-units of Ethereum’s currency, called gwei. The cost of a transaction is the gas limit multiplied by the gas price. Transactions can also include an additional tip to the validator, called a priority fee. You can find the gas price at a given time using [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).

1 ETH splits into one billion gwei, but even with such small amounts costs can add up. The price in gwei that a transaction will require is based on current network traffic. These prices are very dynamic. When many people are performing transactions at the same time, the price of gas in gwei tends to go up. This is because blocks are limited in size to 30 million units of gas maximum, and people will outbid each other to ensure their transactions are executed.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eqm824g6e3ra1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4b3572b088b3bc22f66ccf16f4ce4728391c5e9e

Block space is limited, so the price of that space changes with how popular it is at a given point in time. This is the other side of the defense; performing an attack that spams a network to drain it of its resources (known as a DDoS attack) would increase gas prices for each subsequent transaction in that attack, making it increasingly expensive.

A notably different example is Solana which has a fixed gas fee for all transactions. This has proven to not be an adequate defense, causing the chain to stop operating on many occasions.

I understand that you cant alter a smart contract after its been deployed. But how can i do what i want. Like i need to be able to change the ft minting price if polygon ever becomes too expensive.

Also i understand i could make it so that people need to supply for example a stable coin pegged to like a dollar. So that way the price says the same. But I'd rather have it for just polygon matic as the price.

But is this possible without stable coins? Is there a way i can change the price per NFT? Or is there like a script that is able to do this in a smart contract or other ways?"

I would like to save my seedphrase on the cloud using multiple levels of encryption.

\>Memory/Ancecdote: This most important layer being memory/anecdotes where for example if a word is 'Charge' I write something like

            First three letters of my father's oldest uncle ( who is called Charlie)/Last three letters are the country where I went on exchange: How it appears on tv in english on a football match but unscramble it.
    
    So to decrypt it would be: Cha from Charlie and G-e-r in any order. I would get charge.

\>Non English language: Just reducing chances

    I will skip this layer here to avoid misunderstanding

\>Intentionally misspelling: So that machines (yet) dont pick up on language and make sensoe of it

    Phurst thuree leters af my fathhers eldest onkel..... 

\>Simple math based encryption: TO avoid the text being understood by any human reader of any language as something sound

    Phurst thuree....
    
    P->Q  h->i u->v etc.
    sentence appearing as 
    
    """"Phurst thuree"" appearing as ""Qivtu uisff....""

I believe that unless I lose my memory, this is the safest way to store information (in my head). I am much less likely to forget my uncles name, or university country etc. than random words.

&#x200B;

The reason I am against physical storage is because no matter how safe, it has a greater chance of getting lost or stolen.

&#x200B;

Please share your knowledge on risks of this method

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you for mostly constructive criticism on this method. I would like to address that because of my work I do have to move around every year or two and don't have a permanent home. Thus safely taking physical notes through airport security checks etc. at least feels unwise. Any of you on the same boat? Secondly I feel like (as some have addressed), hiding stuff in a safe may be dangerous  in case of a threat or robbery attempt as the attackers always go for the safe rather than a pile of books for example. Then again, hiding in plain sight is riskier. I do understand that this risk is little to none for many of you.

Most have addressed the fact that storing information in memory is a bad idea long term. Some aspect of memory always required (i.e. where is my seedphrase stored: in a safe, in the office desk etc.). If indeed the issue is about forgetting, would it help in practicing the 'self created encryption' periodically (every year) mitigate the risk?

It doesn't necessarily have to be a new game, but it would be cool if some of the existing ones implemented crypto/NFTs at one point to allow players to monetize the effort they put into the game by selling NFT items, in-game currency as cryptocurrency, etc. Ethereum would be a solid base for a project like this because of its stability and versatility, however, the game would probably have its own coin.

My favorite existing ETH-based project would probably be NFT City Miner. I played the previous game made by these devs (Crypto Idle Miner), and it had me occupied for months, so I assume the new one would be even more interesting, especially considering it would contain NFT buildings in form of owning virtual property.

I also think there must be a catch on Non KYC exchanges but I feel like I’d rather go with the Non KYC ones. I’m not gonna do large transactions anyway and with that, I’d just use the Non KYC Exchanges for now. So with some research, I found **LocalCryptos**, **Houdini Swap**, **LocalMonero**, and **KuCoin** (with a certain limit), but I'm not really keen on P2P marketplaces. 

Someone suggested P2P marketplaces but if it’s security I’m looking for, I’d rather go with an exchange. Right now I’m leaning towards buying it on a non KYC DEX exchange rather than a CEX exchange so **Bisq**, **HodlHodl** is on the bottom of my list (I’ll still consider them just in case or for future uses who knows). Thanks for helping out."

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

Here is a link to the text: [https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686/text](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686/text)

Bills are formulated in a confusing (but ultimately logical) way. Section 3 Part (a) essentially says the following:

The   Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the relevant executive   department and agency heads, is authorized to and shall take action to   identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise   mitigate, including by negotiating, entering into, or imposing, and   enforcing any mitigation measure to address any risk arising from any   covered transaction by any person, or with respect to any property,   subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that the Secretary   determines poses an undue or unacceptable risk to the national security   of the United States or the safety of United States persons.

A   ""covered transaction"" is described in Section 2 Part (4), and seems   like it might be open to general interpretation that includes crypto.

We   learned about behind-closed-doors involvement of anti-crypto people in   law drafting when anti-crypto language was slipped into the   Infrastructure Bill. The right answer to that is eternal vigilance."
359,2023-03-26,Ethereum Layer 2 Application Specific Rollups and Their Future.,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/122sokj/ethereum_layer_2_application_specific_rollups_and/,2,"Time for a post about Application Specific Rollups + General Purpose Rollups on how they often get lumped together, even though they couldn't be more different, and how they are complimentary not in competition. 

In 6 months-a-year, you're going to hear non-stop about  zkEVMs. They really are the endgame for Ethereum scaling on L2 + I couldn't be more excited for this but this often leads people to believe that App Specific rollups will be left behind - this couldn't be more wrong. 

General Purpose L2's on Ethereum - like Optimism, Arbitrum (OP rollups), Scroll, Polygon + Taiko (zkEVMs) - are all trying to do one thing (in different ways): 
Basically, reproduce Ethereum, but on a faster + cheaper L2 environment, still tied to Ethereum L1 for security. 

If successful, this will be great for Ethereum. Ethereum, as it is today, will all move to Layer 2, and Ethereum will be a viable option to power all of crypto all in one place.  There will be no need for competing L1s aka ""ETH killers"". 

But what about Application Specific rollups? I think calling them all rollups confuses people, because it somewhat implies they are all trying to do the same thing. They are not - they compliment eachother, they do not compete with eachother. General Purpose rollups are trying to reproduce Ethereum on L2 - they are for devs to build apps on. App-Specific rollups are completely different - they are like complete, vertically integrated super apps/ecosystems. They are for end users to experience the power of crypto. 

If/when General Purpose rollups (likely zkEVMs) are successful on Ethereum L2 + bring all of Ethereum to L2. I actually envision a world where almost all of the biggest applications in the world - like the Twitters, PayPals, Ubers, etc - all become L3s on top of zkEVMs. 

Loopring for example, is trying to be one of these super apps - a one stop shop for all things crypto - decentralized finance (DeFi) + NFTs in one place for the end user. Finally bringing the meme of ""Being your own Bank"" to reality. This could become reality on L3. 

If you want to build a Web3 super app, harnessing the power of crypto for the world, you will have a choice: 

- Build it directly on Ethereum L2 - on top of a general purpose rollup - fast + cheap option, but it won't be optimized for your specific products / applications. 

OR

 -Build a vertically integrated super app on L3 - inside your custom made rollup that can be highly optimized + customized for your specific products / applications. 

These rollups can submit their proofs directly to L2 instead of L1, making them even faster + cheaper. 

This also gives Web 2 companies a chance to come to Web3 - the next frontier. Most of Web2, if they want to compete in the future, will want to be a part of Web3, and will want an environment that is highly customizable + optimizable for their end users.

This is where application-specific rollups shine. Loopring has already proven this with GameStop helping power their new thriving NFT Marketplace. I expect many more big names to follow suit into Web3 - and most won't want to build their own rollups. 

So in conclusion, while everyone is talking about general purpose rollups + scaling Ethereum on L2, try not to forget about Application Specific rollups - they are just getting started also I am extremely excited for the future of both. 

General Purpose rollups (likely zkEVMs) are going to be the endgame for Ethereum scaling through L2. They will take all of Ethereum to Layer 2 - making Ethereum THE place to be for all things crypto (DeFi, NFTs, DAOs + every other future use case) 
No other L1s needed. 

App-Specific rollups, like Loopring will likely live on L3, creating vertically integrated, end-user focused super apps. End users will eventually not even realize they are using crypto - all of this should be abstracted away. Creating a Web2 user experience on Web3."

[Roofstock onChain](https://onchain.roofstock.com/) is an example of a company that does this. 

I read recently in the news that the first home was sold for $250,000.00 on the ethereum blockchain. I sort of get that ownership of the home is represented by a digital token/s that multiple people can own fractional shares of or tokens of. How is it possible to assure, though, that these token holders are reimbursed when someone buys the home? E.g. let's say a blockchain company is selling a home, whereby ownership is represented by a token/nft- the buyer will most likely pay the blockchain company in dollars. I thought the whole idea was to assure that the token holders don't need to establish any trust with the blockchain company officers. The officers, though, can keep the money if they are dishonest. Even if the buyer pays in crypto, the officers could ask the buyer to send the cypto into a wallet that the token holders don't own.

It's my distinct belief that when a virtual world arises in which we can have a sense of presence equivalent to that which we have in physical life, virtual worlds will revolutionize our world. 

# Augmented reality as the basis 

I believe that augmented reality will pave the way over the next 5-7 years for people to enjoy the convenience of a computer you don't have to hold in your hand and that can understand your hand movements as physical gestures interpretable by the machine. 

There are a lot of people who really struggle to understand computers and I believe augmented reality will make it much easier for them to interact with computers as a whole through spatial computing. 

This underlying utility may pave the way for a virtual world ecosystem in which people may be able to get the same level of the sense of presence that they get in physical life in a digital space. 

# The transition to digital civilization 

It's my belief that when we are able to get the same sense of presence in a virtual space as in a physical space, we will stop building physical spaces. 

# The potential for crisis 

Every virtual world creator has the right to manage their own virtual world as they wish. However, if a virtual world becomes essential for human life, that creator may create large-scale censorship for a large part of the human population. 

Social media giants already ban their members on a regular basis without even stating the reason. For most, these platforms are not essential for life or income but one day virtual worlds may become the reality most call home. 

* What if one day what we say could get us banned from what most people consider reality? 

# The context for my question

I'd like to come up with a charter of rights and freedoms for the Metaverse and I would love your input. 

The key problem at hand is how we balance the rights of a virtual world creator to the rights of those who inhabit virtual worlds. 

There's an inherent tension between protecting the rights that a creator has over the world that they create versus the rights of individual users. 

## Progress so far

**Right to obscurity**

* The right not to be individually penalized for non-criminal acts done outside of a particular virtual world.

**Right to migration**

* The right to switch from virtual world to virtual world without contractual hindrance.

**Right of privacy**

1. The right not to be tracked in a persistent, identifiable fashion, without expressed, written, and updated consent.
2. The right to separately agree to the tracking of political or religious beliefs.
3. The right to take down, or disassociate from, content published by oneself.


## Breaking down the progress

**Right to obscurity**

Obscurity is all about making sure a global reputation system for the Metaverse is never created. I believe a global reputation system that's interoperable between worlds has the ability to create global censorship and therefore each virtual world should judge its members by their behavior within that world. 

If not, a single mistake, in the limited interpretation of what a mistake could be by one world, may cause us problems for the rest of our life. 

**Right to migration**

As long as we can use viable alternatives to a virtual world, we are never locked out of the Metaverse as a whole. 

The big problem here is that the network effect may make those alternatives unviable just as competing with YouTube is almost totally unviable because of Youtube’s massive viewer base. 

**Right of privacy**

This is all about that extra layer of protection so that you can't be identified as belonging to a particular community as that identification process is the first step to maltreatment. 

# Ok, my question for real this time

**How do we ensure that individual rights are fully protected even as we transition from the physical to the digital?**

How do we avoid the network effect, (people wanting to be where the other people are) along with the enormous complexity of virtual worlds laying the foundation for a new reality that resembles the lack of rights and freedoms we see from today’s social media giants? 

Let's say that we create a right to interoperability, such a right creates a financial obligation on the creator of a virtual world, something which will stifle innovation potentially. 

Moreover, interoperability isn't practical on so many levels when it comes to complex technology. 

Migration, sure but if one virtual world has the people it's not like those people can just walk into another virtual world -- keep in mind that virtual world creators size all of their doors to all of the items that you could wear in a potential virtual world. 

A virtual world is a bespoke experience and it's not like you can just mix and match without a jarring and problematic mishmash that leads to less of a sense of immersion."

*This is a linkpost for*  [*https://astrum5000.substack.com/p/what-properties-do-blockchains-fundamentally*](https://cryptosophy.xyz/out?url=https%3A%2F%2Fastrum5000.substack.com%2Fp%2Fwhat-properties-do-blockchains-fundamentally)*, visit the post to subscribe!*

Blockchains are sometimes presented as mystical creations, but the main significant thing about them is simple: they are digital substrates which unlock unprecedented levels of protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence (PCP) guarantees for the software that they run. For some applications, these properties can prove very valuable. Here they are spelled out:

* Protocol adherence: The guarantee that a software system is following a given protocol.
* Censorship resistance: The guarantee that users can properly interact with a software system.
* Persistence: The guarantee that a software system will continue running far into the future.

Those main seem intriguing, but what contributes to a digital substrates ability to guarantee them? The contributions mainly comes from two characteristics:

1. Trustlessness: The minimization of trust required from the human operators of a digital substrate for a given PCP property to be upheld.
2. Resiliency: The maximization of resiliency of a digital substrate to defend a given PCP property against attack from a third party.

With those terms out of the way, we can dig into an analysis of the two main digital substrates for running software: servers, and blockchains. Let’s take a look at each of them in turn to better understand how they compare in their PCP guarantees.

## Servers

At a high level, a server is a single computer running software that people can interact with over the internet. Servers are what the internet is built on today. That being said, they don’t offer the strongest PCP guarantees:

1. Trustlessness: it’s necessary to trust that the operator of a server will uphold protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence. At any moment the operator of a server could modify its behavior to breach its protocol, censor certain users, or terminate.
2. Resiliency: a software deployment is only as resilient as the operator of the server. At any moment they could get coerced by a third party into modifying the server’s behavior to breach the protocol, censor certain users, or terminate. Alternatively, it only takes a single hack to take control of the server, and a single explosive to destroy it.

Now that we’ve seen what servers are capable of, let’s see how blockchains compare.

&#x200B;

## Blockchains

At a high level, a blockchain is a network of servers that redundantly execute the same software and reach consensus on its status through a system of checks and balances. Part of its power lies in its inclusivity - anyone can contribute to the network by running a node without needing to ask anyone for permission. The idea of blockchain is to be *the* digital substrate which *best maximizes* PCP guarantees:

1. Trustlessness: Let’s break down this analysis into each of protocol adherence, censorship resistance, and persistence.
   1. Protocol adherence: every user has the ability to verify whether or not a blockchain is following a given protocol, so there’s no need to trust the operators of the blockchain to uphold protocol adherence.
   2. Censorship resistance: as long as at least a few percent of the servers which make up a blockchain don’t try to censor a given transaction, it will not be censored. Coupling this with the fact that anyone can contribute to the operation of a blockchain by permissionlessly running a node, we find that blockchains are highly censorship resistant without needing to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold censorship resistance.
   3. Persistence: anybody can contribute to the operation of a blockchain, so there’s no need to trust that any individual blockchain operator will uphold persistence.
2. Resiliency: following from the trustlessness properties, there is no centralized point of failure that a third party can coerce, hack, or destroy to induce a blockchain to break from protocol adherence, censorship resistance, or persistence. Instead, the third party will need to coerce the users themselves to not interact with a given blockchain. This is much more difficult. 

# So What? When Does It Make Sense To Use a Blockchain?

Deciding between running software on a server or a blockchain comes down to a cost benefit analysis. The main advantage of using blockchain is its PCP guarantees, while its limitations include slower performance and weaker privacy capabilities (although these limitations are being eroded over time). In which applications are PCP guarantees actually valuable?

For many applications, using a server is the better option. PCP guarantees are mainly important in cases where a significant conflict of interest appears between the operators of software and its users (trustlessness solves this), or when there are concerns of a third party interfering with software (resiliency solves this).

Today, conflicts of interests are typically solved via government regulation. In fintech apps for example, rather than trusting software operators to uphold PCP, you rely on a government to ensure that the software operators adequately follow PCP.

As far as concerns of a third party interfering with software goes, today, applications solve this by relying on a government to defend servers and punish those who try to interfere.

So what’s left? What types of applications does it make sense to deploy on a blockchain? We’ll answer this question in a future post. Subscribe for updates!"

401,2023-03-22,Centralization Possibilities,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11yvmac/centralization_possibilities/,3,"**tl;dr this is some kind of semi-coherent train of thought(which I can provide links to subtopics in the comments). hypothetically, we should be able to confront the dilution of network effects by focusing on a supercritical subset of features. how do we realize the various applications of the ""fat protocol"" thesis for other aspects like community building, governance diversification, IRL impact, etc?**

just laying out some thoughts, however disjointed they may be. I'm kind of arriving on a realization that there's so much potential in the already-deployed, but over an unnecessarily diffuse landscape. a good demonstration of this to me has been the plethora of different talks from ETHDenver. more specifically, just look at all of the discussion and deployment around EIP-4337. tbh, there may be more of an opportunity to debate the finer details like the bundlers and the authentication methods than there is to eliminate the massive ecosystem cost of phishing links and lost seedphrases.

there's also very fundamental communities in Ethereum, like gitcoin and scaffoldeth, where the public good can be consumed at scale but the core maintenance and composition of those is not proportionate (though arguably substantial). I'm not really discussing a problem, it's more of an subnominal opportunity. likewise, I'm not saying people aren't aware, it's more of a dilemma where the attention spans aren't overlapping on whatever public space we cover, and we're spending excessive capital ""treating the symptoms instead of curing the disease"".

there's also the unspoken capture of zero-sum capital by inefficent mechanisms. for example, if every project  airdrop'd tokens/allowlists/access to recipients on the basis that they wholesale ""like/retweet/tag/comment"", the outcome of that spent social capital is a network that echoes to itself. same for a lot of DAOs (plutocratic ones especially), if there's a sociopolitical whip to attend the same meetings, ratify the same proposals, agree on the same adversarial rules, burn the same gas, gaslight in the same manner, then we're spending extra on bargaining costs with less compatible communities, and getting more capitalized to become a monoculture. and we're losing the small fish along the way.

there's parts of ethereum that do really well in these environments. MEV is actually working out really well when you look at it as a compositional problem. DeFi protocols innovate the classes of operation, liquidity, and hypothecation. node operators innovate on the other side, and in between there are a bunch of grayhats arbing the difference and forcing adaptation. crypto social media is really entertaining, there are maximalists and NFTers and other tings. there are new social protocols that run on their own rollup, or a sidechain, or even another network altogether. entire EVM sidechains & rollups are manifesting with modularity, DeFi consensus, you name it. airdrops & farmers continue to provide us a case study of sybil resistance in practice.

but I still get this feeling that its too diffuse, and we've reached this stage where the aggregate sociocultural downside is growing faster than we're optimizing & accelerating critical, introspective development. personally, I'm totally fine with how the protocol is developing & scaling, and the applications on top are fun, if nothing else. the succinct cryptography is fascinating and the privacy innovations are inspring. however, there's too much opportunity & stakes on the table to ignore.

this is what I'm proposing: there needs to be a stack of the ""fat protocol"" vibe and ""social architecture"" without any contrived, pyramid-scheme, ponzinomic, or walled-garden nonsense. git is crazy scalable software because it is so undefined. ethereum already has crazy scalable n-tiered architecture (like Default, Pipeline, and Diamonds). hypercertificates are already crazy scalable forms of fungible, verifiable credentials. I think there's a supercritical, supermodular application that inherits the social tech from teams like Lens, Orbis, Farcaster, the compositional tech from Scaffold, Gnosis, Gelato, Uniswap, Wagmi, & OS tools like Alpaca, Langchain, Forge, Arweave, ethOS, and others. there should be an OS-agnostic, token-agnostic open forum & groupchat platform with extendable, modular abilities like signing multisig transactions, deploying AMOs on other chains, deploying software, funding public goods, etc.

in other words, I'm just saying (and experimenting) that the focus should be centralized on the core thesis: ethereum can be an internet-tier technology tree at a time when the world needs such a technology tree. it's kind of a farce whenever there's a random DAO committing death-by-committee/death-by-slushfund, whenever there's a seedphrase watering-hole scam on Twitter/Discord, or just the broader ""monkey jpeg""/ ""$$$ hack""/""VC dump to community"" image the public consumes. so let's just focus on the supercritical root application of that tech tree."

I already tried here in Czech Republic but out of 40 companies only one answered. The information would be about which cryptocurrency does your company use, how often do you use them (how often does a customer buy with crypto), information on the share of these transactions in the annual turnover (if possible) and what do you personally think are the advantages and disadvantages of using cryptocurrency in a company.

I created a free endpoint for fetching historical OHLC and real-time crypto prices. 

Decided to post here as I have seen some ask about historical ethereum prices before.

I added Github with examples here: [https://github.com/martkir/dex-prices-syve](https://github.com/martkir/dex-prices-syve).

I  created the endpoint to address some of the issues I had when working / prototyping with free plans of current providers (e.g. coinmarketcap / coingecko). Main things being:

&#x200B;

* Low resolution (can only get hourly or daily price data but I need 1min or even second data)
* Limited historical data (no historical data or less than 1 year)
* Data is super delayed - coinmarketcap update frequency of OHLC data is something like 5-10minutes
* No data on niche / very small cap tokens (which sometimes I needed)

&#x200B;

Anyway, hope some of you will find this endpoint useful. 

This is the first release but I am planning to expand it more. So feedback / suggestions would be very welcome :)"

Maybe some of you have seen that. Deleted the post by now due to privacy reasons but they stole like 10k$ in ETH, ERC20 and ETH L2s. The reason for the hack was most likely the flawed TustWallet extension, when I used it immediately after “CZ Binance” had posted about it. 

They left me a message on chain saying:

“We are white hat. We found a problem with your wallet and to protect the funds we moved them out to store them securely. Please send a transaction from current and new wallet to verify yourself and get the funds back”

For me that sounded like they are just messing with me. I have send then indeed a transaction from the hacked address and new address. Nothing happened for like 2 days. I had given up on that money. 

I contacted TrustWallet Support, they told me that I should send a few 0 ETH transactions to the account, where my stolen funds were sitting and include my new address as a message. 

And yeah now 5 days later, they have sent me all funds back. I would never in a thousand years have believed that I will ever get that funds back. 

And that is not all: I was actively DCA’ing on that compromised wallet. They saved me from a huge misery in a couple of months! I told them in some of my on chain messages to keep 20% as a fee, but they didn’t. They send me the full amount back. 

So does anyone know a charity or so that accepts ETH donations? I wanna donate a small part of this money ☺️

EDIT: Donated around 500$ to GiveDirectly https://www.givedirectly.org/ and Trees For The Future https://trees.org/crypto/. Plus I am going to donate a similar amount to a local charity of my hometown!

That is it for donating from my side, so you can stop sending DM’s ;)"
416,2023-03-21,Use cases for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/11xhi4y/use_cases_for_smart_contracts_on_the_ethereum/,13,"Smart contracts definitely showcase one of the most exciting applications of blockchain technology by enabling secure and efficient automation of various processes. And with Ethereum being the most popular blockchain platforms, we can expect a versatile and robust infrastructure for building smart contracts.

After looking into some of the major industries in the crypto space, here are 4 common use cases I've come across in regards to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:

* **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: the use of smart contracts here help facilitate transactions like lending, trading and borrowing which in turn helps in democratizing finance, making it more accessible to all, and reducing the need for middle men.For example, Uniswap is one such DeFi platform that uses smart contracts to exchange tokens without the need a centralized matching engine.
* **Supply Chain Management**:  smart contracts help to automate supply chain processes in a number of different ways- from verifying product authenticity to managing inventory and payments which in turn leads to increasing transparency, real-time data, reducing costs, and preventing fraud.For example, Morpheus Network automates the flow of information and goods between suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and end customers through smart contracts executed on the Ethereum blockchain.
* **Real Estate**: smart contracts enable tokenization of real estate, fractional ownership and help with streamlining transactions. This can help increase liquidity, reduce costs, and also make it easier for all to access real estate investments.For example, Propy uses smart contracts in order to automate and secure the various stages of a real estate transaction which also acts as a digital escrow service.
* **Gaming**: Smart contracts enable true ownership of in-game assets, create decentralized gameplays, and facilitate peer-to-peer gaming experiences.For example, Decentraland makes use of smart contracts which allows gamers to buy and sell virtual real estate and in-game assets in a transparent and secure way.

I also came across the use of smart contracts in **identity verification**, but a **couple of questions** I have in relation to this are along the lines of how can cases wherein we see discrepancies in the information provided by users are handled? And also whether smart contracts can be audited to ensure its accuracy and efficiency?   
It would be great if someone could help me understand this better.

Have you come across some other common use case for smart contacts on the Ethereum blockchain? Would love to hear more about that.  
Thank you!"

I bought Ethereum and Bitcoin a few years ago and just had it sitting there all this time. I decided to withdraw it the other day, so I fired up the Ledger Nano S but it's out of date and won't do the transactions.

No worries. I know the seed phrase so I got a new wallet and was able to access my Bitcoin. However, the Ethereum comes up as $0. I thought both Ethereum and Bitcoin would be linked to the seed. phrase, but it seems only Bitcoin was.

They were kept in the same wallet (or so I thought). So... I can see the Ethereum balance on my Ledger Live wallet, but can't send it anywhere, and can't load it onto a new wallet.

I may be able to update the Ledger device, but I'm afraid that if I do, I'll lose access to the Ethereum... any tips?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone for your helpful comments and for explaining about the derivation paths. I have my seed phrase so was comfortable enough to update the firmware on my Ledger device and all seems fine. It didn't even require me to re-enter the seed phrase. So the Ethereum is still there and ready to be transferred, but not to any of the scammers in my DMs.  "

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Where's the best place to buy ETH?**

There are many centralized exchanges that support Ethereum. If you live in the US, the most popular exchanges are Coinbase, Gemeni and Kraken. Coinbase users can use Coinbase Pro for lower fees.

**How can I stake my ETH?**

The best way to stake your ETH: by running your own validator.

* Running your own validator requires a modern computer and 32 ETH. Visit /r/ethstaker for more details

**Why are Ethereum transaction fees so high?**

Like most blockchains, Ethereum fees are determined by supply-and-demand. The large demand to use Ethereum has pushed transaction fees quite high (however, fees were just a few cents only 2 years ago). Fees are especially high during market volatility, and during NFT drops.

**What is being done to lower Ethereum transaction fees?**

Ethereum fees are reduced by using layer-2 rollups. Rollups are scaling solutions that allow for significantly cheaper transactions, while still maintaining Ethereum's security.

Additionally, data shards will make rollups even cheaper.

While rollups are cutting-edge technology being actively developed, a number are already live on Ethereum mainnet. Visit [l2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/) to learn more about rollups.

**What's the best wallet for Ethereum?**

The most popular tool for using decentralized applications is Metamask. However, for security reasons, we recommend using a hardware wallet such as a Trezor or Ledger.

I wanted to start a discussion and ask a couple questions that might help expand my understanding of smart contracts and also those in the same boat as me:

* What are some of the most interesting use cases for smart contracts you've seen so far on the Ethereum network? 
* Have you created a smart contract yourself, or have any tips for beginners looking to learn more?
* How do you see the future of smart contracts evolving, both within the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond? 

Personally for me, I've been intrigued by the the use of smart contracts in supply chain management. I see it having the potential to greatly improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance transparency and accountability. Some of the platforms I looked into were VeChain and Morpheus Network in regards to how blockchain technology and smart contracts can be used to transform traditional supply chain processes while allowing for the creation of immutable agreements that execute automatically when predefined conditions are met.

While we are busy working, buying, hodl and DRS'ing. The politicians are hard at work to our detriment.

Everyone needs to do their part to kill bills like this. I'm having a heck of a time getting traction to kill it in MT.

This exact bill is in other states right now. In the link I listed below it shows you where to go to lookup if the bill is in your state. We need help in MT and other states. This crap is buried in a 150 page bill about uniform code revision...like all the other bills.

It made it out of the MT senate and will now go to MT house. If you are in MT (or not) and would like to help stop this bill, please contact me. The current legislation working through the system in Montana. Buried in a 150 page bill is (that has a ridiculous title - Generally revise uniform commercial code) :

"" (y) ""Money"" means a medium of exchange that is currently authorized or adopted by a domestic or (15) foreign government. The term includes a monetary unit of account established by an intergovernmental (16)organization or by pursuant to an agreement between two or more countries. The term does not include an (17) electronic record that is a medium of exchange recorded and transferable in a system that existed and operated (18) for the medium of exchange before the medium of exchange was authorized or adopted by the government.

This year similar bills were successfully vetoed by Kristi Noem in SD, and AZ killed it as well. But other states aren't so lucky. We all need to fight these kinds of bills. We will not be able to do all the good we want or be our own bank. I suggest you find some watchdog groups in your state. One of the watchdogs in my state sent out a big alert. Take action in your state.

While the banking industry is burning (by design) to introduce CBDC...they are busy making sure we are stuck in their rigged system.

The language of the bill basically says that when the government says the dollar is invalid, and there is something to replace it, then that’s final an no one can resist it.

They are implementing it on a state level so there will be no wiggle room.

Montana’s bill is SB 370 and OPPOSE. If you do take action and call or email the committee, please be respectful and courteous. If you are not they throw away the messages.

The first link is from a sub stack dude that explains what is going on and what this bill means. All the bills going through right now for revision in UCC have the EXACT same wording. Go to minute 48 - 52 minutes. This will give the best explanation straight outta their own mouth. He specifically gives information on how Bitcoin is money by todays standards.

Lastly, another user Waldo, helped me with this. This CBDC bill is truly mind numbing. Thankful for Reddit being down for 4 hours because discord is how we connected.

My two cents. ALL CBDC bills need to be killed quickly and swiftly. I’m mad that it made this far in MT.
