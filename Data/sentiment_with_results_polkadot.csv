Now on the dashboard, I see a message that I have not set my controller, but next to the Controller Account in the dashboard, it does show the address of my DOT account from my ledger. It also shows same address in top right of screen but there it is labeled as nominator.

Do I need to set a different account for my controller? Do i need 2 accounts? I'd prefer to just use the one on my ledger to keep it simple.

- Having to constantly nominate validators in the active validation set.
- Trying to constantly resupply above staking min
- Trying to constantly resupply above bonding minimum
- Having to understand and reorder bags if you would otherwise qualify for staking rewards but aren't. 
- Having to learn and understand staking pools because solo nominations can't keep up with staking supply minimums only to get locked out from new bonding minimum requirements.


Things are a headache even when you do it right and if you can't stake you lose out due to how drastic the inflation rate is while taking on price volatility with more risk to the downside during a bear market.

Maxis and shillers feel free to downvote but these are valid concerns a regular joe has when considering which projects are worth supporting and investing in. Why polkadot infrastructure design is so against small time investors boggles the mind. I have no quarrels with what the project is seeking to achieve nor with what progress it has made and is about to make, and while I want to support the infrastructure I just can't engage with this project without incredible resistance and I'm inclined to wish things my best and peace out.

So roughly a month after the last minimum staking amount got up, we now have another update with the minimum staking amount going from 297 to 327 DOT in order to earn rewards.  That's roughly another 180 usd for someone who is on the staking edge.  
That's in theory, but in practice you need 400 just to be sure you will get any rewards.  
I now question myself and all of us, what is the ideology behind Polkadot Network regarding the constant move of the minimum amount needed?  
Why would someone who is trying to solo stake and earn rewards be obliged to get extra DOT every month?  
 In practice, you will be spending 150+us every month in order to keep up the track on the constant minimum amount going up.  
And please don't tell me about staking pools, this has nothing to do with that.

""It is sad to see Mixbytes‚Äô decision to take these necessary measures, but it is justifiable given the rationale presented. As a staunch advocate for Polkadot, I must acknowledge that the utility of LST and staking protocols with respect to decentralization may not be as robust as those found in Ethereum, Polygon, and other comparable platforms.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the DeFi ecosystem within Polkadot is still relatively underdeveloped, thus limiting the potential applications and benefits of LST to promote increased use cases and stakeholder commitment.

While this is a somber moment, it is my hope that our paths may intertwine once more through collaborative efforts in the future. The professionalism and excellence demonstrated by Mixbytes throughout our partnership have been truly commendable, and I extend my warmest wishes for success in all forthcoming endeavors.

In light of these circumstances, I believe the request made to the DAO is quite reasonable, as the subsequent support for the shutdown and unstaking process will undoubtedly have implications on revenue and put additional strain on available budgets. Thus, it seems prudent to lend our support and understanding to Mixbytes during this challenging period.""",0.8929253816604614,0.03264755755662918,0.07442711293697357,4.650694448092124

When I say ""Fair Ordering"" I mean the provable guarantee that your transaction to the network will get the same ordering treatment as any other transaction -- no preferences whatsoever (this is important for DeFi, for example, where you can be sure no one is front-running your order).  For example, BTC has miners which, in turn, choose to order the transactions within a given block.  Since the miners can order the transaction in any way they want BTC does not support Fair Ordering.  

I understand Polkadot has blocks... Are those blocks mined?  And, if so, does it support Fair Ordering?

TIA!",0.04167936369776726,0.038131434470415115,0.9201892614364624,2.508869822539698
61,2023-03-29,"  We believe there‚Äôs a great need for automation to be controlled by its creator, especially in a multi-chain environment. The OAK Blockchain will enable other blockchains to offload expensive automation computations from their system to OAK with an event-driven execution virtual machine. This system provides ownership, flexibility, and security for financial transactions, metaverse actions, and any interactions on-chain.   


 Polkadot and its canary network Kusama are built using Substrate. By building on this framework, OAK can leverage the extensive functionality that Substrate includes out-of-the-box, rather than building it ourselves. This includes peer-to-peer networking, consensus mechanisms like Aura, governance functionality, an EVM implementation, and more. 

 As a parachain, OAK will be able to directly integrate with and move tokens between all parachains and parathreads on the network with guaranteed security and transport from the relay chain Polkadot or Kusama.    


Come build with us!

Peter Ludlow - 1996

**Introduction:** ***\[TLDR at the end\]***

Reflecting on the events of the past year concerning regulations and the resurgence of concerns over bank failures, I began to contemplate the purpose of regulations and how the crypto space currently exists in a limbo, awaiting stringent regulations from powerful governments that could potentially hinder its growth.

However, it's essential to consider the true, supposed, intentions behind regulations: to protect the market from collapsing and damaging the economy, defend against external threats, safeguard small and medium investors, and ensure that the systems function correctly.

As long-time participants in the new digital landscape, we are well-aware of the presence of malicious actors. One of the advantages of this environment is the ability to thoroughly investigate providers by examining their on-chain history. The process becomes more challenging when we need to venture into the real world, where situations are often messy, subjective, and non-deterministic.

In the blockchain space, variables are more manageable, often fewer in number and self-imposed compared to the real world.

* *So why wait for external regulations when the tools to protect investors already exist within our own ecosystem?*
* *Why construct the constraints of traditional asset classes when code can automate trust and reduce counterparty risk?*
* *Why be content with centralized power structures when decentralized networks can redistribute power and promote equitable participation?*

This thought process led to the development of the idea: *Self-Imposed DeFi Regulations on Blockchain Networks ‚Äì A Necessary Step for Sustainable Growth.*

**Regulations on traditional financial systems:**

In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, a range of regulatory measures were introduced to enhance stability, transparency, and accountability within the financial sector. These regulations can potentially be adapted for the DeFi space to achieve similar objectives:

1. **Capital and Liquidity Requirements**: Post-crisis, the financial sector saw the implementation of regulations such as Basel III, which established minimum capital and liquidity requirements for banks. This was done to ensure banks could weather financial shocks and prevent insolvencies and systemic risks.
2. **Stress Testing**: Following the crisis, regulators started mandating stress tests for banks to assess their ability to endure adverse economic situations. These tests help identify vulnerabilities and ensure the resilience of financial systems under extreme market conditions.
3. **Transparency and Disclosure**: Regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States were introduced to enhance transparency. The Act required financial institutions to disclose comprehensive information about their operations, risks, and performance to promote trust and minimize potential for fraud.
4. **Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**: In the wake of the crisis, traditional finance strengthened KYC and AML requirements to tackle illicit activities. This involved implementing identity verification and transaction monitoring systems, which allowed for compliance with global AML standards while still maintaining privacy and decentralization.

**Common Parachain objectives:**

I propose to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on a Polkadot common good parachain with intents to implement self-imposed DeFi regulations through the following steps:

&#x200B;

1. **Establish Governance Framework:** To begin, the parachain should develop a robust governance framework that allows stakeholders to propose, discuss, and vote on self-imposed regulatory measures. The DAO can use Polkadot's  on-chain governance mechanisms, such as referenda and public proposals, to enable decentralized decision-making.
2. **Define Regulatory Standards:** The DAO should collaborate with industry experts, developers, and community members to define clear regulatory standards for DeFi platforms operating within the common good pallets. These standards should cover aspects such as security measures, risk management, and transparency requirements. They should also be flexible enough to accommodate the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.
3. **Incentivize Compliance:** The DAO should design incentives for DeFi platforms to comply with the self-imposed regulations. This can be done by rewarding platforms that meet the regulatory standards with native parachain tokens, lower transaction fees, higher grading or other benefits. On the other hand, non-compliant platforms could face penalties or increased fees. And other incentive can be implicit through other parachains to require a specific grading for XCM traffic to be opened.
4. **Monitor and Enforce Compliance:** The DAO should establish a system to monitor and enforce compliance with the self-imposed regulations. This can be achieved through periodic audits, on-chain data analysis, and transparent reporting mechanisms. Any violations of the regulatory standards should be addressed through predefined enforcement mechanisms, such as penalties, temporary suspensions, or even permanent bans from the ecosystem, depending on the severity of the violation.

**Pallets targeting regulations directly:**

Developers can create and integrate dedicated pallets for regulatory targets like the ones previously mentioned:

1. **Capital and Liquidity Requirements Pallet**: Develop a pallet that enforces minimum collateralization ratios for lending protocols and requires liquidity providers to maintain adequate reserves. This pallet can also include mechanisms for monitoring and adjusting these ratios based on market conditions.
2. **Stress Testing Pallet**: Create a pallet that facilitates regular stress tests on DeFi platforms to evaluate their ability to withstand adverse economic scenarios. This pallet can provide tools for simulating extreme market conditions and assessing the resilience of the platform's smart contracts, algorithms, and risk management systems.
3. **Transparency and Disclosure Pallet**: Develop a pallet that enforces transparency and disclosure requirements for DeFi platforms. This pallet can require platforms to provide clear documentation, maintain open-source code, and submit to regular audits of their smart contracts. It can also include mechanisms for reporting and verifying the disclosed information.
4. **KYC and AML Pallet**: Create a pallet that supports identity verification and transaction monitoring systems for DeFi platforms. This pallet can enable platforms to comply with global AML standards while preserving privacy and decentralization. It can also facilitate the integration of third-party identity verification solutions (Litentry, Kilt, etc), ensuring a seamless user experience while maintaining compliance.
5. **Develop a Regulatory Compliance Pallet:** Create a dedicated pallet that manages and enforces regulatory compliance across DeFi platforms operating within the common good parachain. The regulatory compliance pallet should include the following features:

* **Compliance Registry:** Maintain a registry of DeFi tools that have successfully complied with the self-imposed regulations. This registry can serve as a reference for users and investors to identify trustworthy platforms within the ecosystem.
* **Automated Monitoring:** Implement mechanisms for automatically monitoring DeFi platforms' adherence to the regulatory standards. The pallet can use on-chain data and XCM interactions to ensure that parachains comply with the established rules. !!!!c.
* **Reporting and Escalation:** Enable a reporting system where users and community members can flag potential regulatory violations. The regulatory compliance pallet should have a mechanism for addressing these reports and escalating issues when necessary.
* **Upgradable Framework:** Design the pallet to be upgradable, allowing for the integration of new regulatory standards as the landscape evolves. This will ensure that the common good parachain stays current with industry best practices and emerging regulatory requirements.

**Enforcement Challenges:**

1. **Parachains**: If parachains have the option to enforce these regulatory pallets, they might also choose not to do so. To address this issue, we could establish alliances of common good parachains that require adherence to these regulations for interaction. The openness of XCM channels between different parachains could be contingent on compliance with these standards.
2. **Incentive Pool**: Parachains can create a pool of incentives to encourage compliance with regulatory measures. For example, Crust could offer lower storage costs to parachains that conduct their due diligence and adhere to self-imposed regulations.
3. **Relay Chain Governance**: If permitted by the governance system, relay chains like Kusama or Polkadot could provide various benefits to compliant parachains, such as reduced XCM transaction fees, assistance with opening channels, and other forms of support.
4. **Dispute Resolution**: Create a dispute resolution mechanism to address disagreements and conflicts related to compliance matters, providing a transparent and decentralized method for resolving issues.
5. **Community Involvement:** Encourage community members to report potential violations, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and vigilance.

Regarding the technical challenges, it's something I encourage people to provide counter-arguments. I'll try to pursue this, but at the moment of writing this my substrate and polkadot architecture knowledge is quite limited as I haven't directly worked with it.

**TL;DR:**

I proposes self-imposed DeFi regulations on blockchain networks for sustainable growth, drawing inspiration from traditional financial regulations introduced after the 2008 crisis.

A Commongood parachain can establish a governance framework, define regulatory standards, incentivize compliance, and monitor/enforce compliance. Pallets can target specific regulatory aspects, such as capital/liquidity requirements, stress testing, transparency/disclosure, and KYC/AML.

To overcome enforcement challenges, alliances of common good parachains, incentive pools, relay chain governance, dispute resolution mechanisms, and community involvement can be utilized.",0.13671272993087769,0.021616069599986076,0.8416712284088135,2.7877416427878203

Mainly, I've read about stakers not getting rewards for various or unknown reasons, being confused, trying to fix it, waiting weeks, and still not getting rewards.  What's happening there?  My understanding is that the validator they chose got more deposits, and became oversubscribed, and the user's staked amount then became too low in comparison, so they stop getting rewards.  Is that right?  That seems unfair to me that your rewards can just stop like that due to a few larger fish pushing you out.

So I'm wondering, what are the various causes of not getting rewards?  Is it just over-subscription and slashing, or are there other reasons?

Is that an issue with nominator pools?

Do you have to keep checking it regularly to make sure you're still getting rewards?  And then if you need to switch over, you have to wait 28 days without rewards? (plus how ever many days lapsed between rewards stopping, and you noticing).

I'm just hesitant because from what I've read and watched, this seems like it's gonna be another thing I have to keep checking on and fiddling around with.  What's the best way to just stake my DOT and get reliable rewards without monitoring and fiddling?

What's the deal with needing 2 wallets.  One for staking and one for fees.  How much DOT should you leave in each wallet?  Is it okay to stake all the DOT in your staking wallet, leaving 0 DOT, and leave like 0.5 DOT in the fees wallet?

Honestly, I'm already more confused than with other blockchains, and am considering swapping my DOT to another stake-able blockchain.

But I rather not!  Any help and explanations will be very much appreciated.

UPDATE:

Thanks for all the advice everybody.  I ended up using Talisman Wallet with my Ledger and it was pretty straight forward.  I chose the Talisman 1 pool.  I left 2 DOT in the wallet for fees.",0.044904716312885284,0.2535139322280884,0.7015813589096069,1.9784769640976416

Block production time on Polkadot relay chain slowed down yesterday (from average 6 seconds to \~ 9 seconds) due to a validator issuing numerous dispute requests. This also had an impact on parachain block times. Block time is now back to normal, and a permanent fix is being developed for the issue.

I posted the following post there yesterday (so note that all the days are now off by one) and it immediately disappeared... It didn't get removed, and it's not awaiting moderator approval... In fact, I got no notification or any indication that it had been hidden (apart from the fact that the crosspost option was missing, and it's sorted out of order in my profile when looking at my posts by New), and it still shows up for me fine, meaning I can view the post like normal and I see it on their sub when I sort by New, etc... But when I look while not logged in, it's gone from their sub, and it's in my profile (see the post ""28 Days Later..."" in my profile) but when I open it the whole body of the post is hidden...

And I messaged them about this (almost 24h ago now) but haven't gotten an answer... And now this morning I just looked through all their New posts, and the last post from any non-Kraken user is from six months ago... So I can only conclude they're ""shadow removing"" posts from their sub...? Which I didn't even know was a thing (and can't find anything about it online, only ""shadow banning"" where _nothing_ you post shows up anywhere on reddit, which is not the case here because I've been talking with other people since then, so I know they can see everything else I post just fine...)

Anyway, that was a long preamble, and that's all it's own separate concern... Now to my original concern... Here's the content of my original post, copy/pasted exactly how I wrote it yesterday...

---

It's been 28 full days (today is day 29) since [Kraken announced it would end all on-chain staking services for U.S. users](https://blog.kraken.com/post/17619/settlement/)... That means [Polkadot's unbonding period](https://support.polkadot.network/support/solutions/articles/65000182201) has lapsed, yet [Polkadot's staking dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) says that 49.xx% of all DOT is still staked, which is the level it has been at for the past few weeks now...

Can someone from Kraken explain this? Has the unbonded DOT just not been unlocked (aka actually withdrawn from on-chain staking) yet? (Maybe that's scheduled to happen later today, or tomorrow?) Or was the amount of DOT being staked by U.S. clients just too insignificant to show-up as a drop in overall stake? Or something else?

Additionally, given the fact that users can withdraw their staked DOT at any time, it makes me wonder how Kraken is even staking users' DOT on-chain, since there's no way to bypass the unbonding period...? Is Kraken actually staking its own private stash of DOT on-chain, and paying users rewards from their own rewards? Or, conversely, servicing withdrawals from their own private stash while they wait for the users' funds to be unlocked, and just hoping there's not a bank-run on staked DOT at some point...? That seems too risky & cumbersome to be likely, but a possibility nonetheless... And I find it even harder to believe that there's not any actual on-chain staking happening at all, given Kraken's official claims (two examples below) but that's technically also a possibility until we hear otherwise...

tl;dr I'm curious about how, exactly -- or even _if_ -- Kraken actually participates in Polkadot's on-chain staking while also being able to process withdrawals without waiting for the unbonding period, and why there was no significant drop in staked DOT due to Kraken ending its staking services for U.S. clients.

126,2023-03-07,"Dear community,  


I'll like to keep you apprised of some possible changes to the staking configurations which might be of interest to you.

The changes are:

1. Increasing the minimum to create a nomination pool from 200 to 500 DOT
2. Increasing the bond side to become a direct nominator from 100 to 200 DOT
3. Enabling fast unstake on Polkadot
4. Increasing the number of Validator Candidates from 1200 to 1500
5. Increasing the number of pools to 256

The changes and the reasoning behind it were suggested by myself [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1650) and is now under consideration by Polkadot's council [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/364).  If the council approves this will go to the public for approval.

To briefly share why these suggestions were made:  


Suggestion #1 was made to ensure that any newly created pool is an active nominator, at the moment there are pools that are below 300 DOT and are not actively staking.  We need to ensure that pools are safe for new nominators.  

The minimum bond to become an active direct nominator is almost 300 DOT, this has left many bonds under this amount inactive.  By increasing the bond size (as seen in #2) it would prevent anyone from creating a reasonably unusable nominator bond and at the same time not impose a new minimum.  Suggestion #2 would also empower suggestion #3 so that users don't need to wait 28 days to unbond if their bond is < the amount required to be considered and active nominator.    

Suggestions #4  was issued in light of future considerations to expand the number of active validators on Polkadot.  Finally suggestion #5 was issued because we're nearing the maximum number of pools, at present there are 102 / 128 pools.  


Feel free to ask any questions and be prepared to vote!

OAK refers to ""Onchain Autonomous Kernel"". OAK Network is an architecture that provides on-chain automation in a decentralized way. It allows other blockchains to offload costly automation onto it using an ""event-driven execution virtual machine"".

Being a parachain on u/Polkadot , OAK can perform trustless cross-chain automation. This means you'll eventually be able to automate theoretical use cases such as transferring GLMR from address A to B on Moonbeam via an automated trigger on the OAK network

The automation process works in two steps:

* Inclusion- including the task in the blockchain
* Execution- execute the task when the condition triggers The automation fee, therefore, depends on the network congestion at the time of inclusion and execution.

&#x200B;

OAK provides automation in three categories listed below.

2. ""Accounts"" > Hamburger at the far right > ""Change reward destination""

I attempted to withdraw my entire Coinbase DOT balance recently and ran into issues. I was sending from Coinbase to my ledger wallet. My DOT ledger address is whitelisted on Coinbase and definitely the address I sent the DOT to but the wallet balance never received them even though there are indications the transaction was successful. At that time of the withdrawal, I was not aware of the different withdrawal options for DOT ('transfer keep alive' vs 'transfer', etc) and I'm not sure Coinbase even had the option to choose one. I didn't know to leave the minimum (1) DOT in my coinbase wallet but It looks like the coinbase transaction went thru as a 'transfer keep alive' but I didn't leave the minimum (1) DOT. I withdrew everything, so how was this transaction shown as successful? I got an email from Coinbase saying it was successful but when I clicked the link to view trxn, the Coinbase transaction page showed zero confirmations (and still shows zero confirmations today) and Polkascan did not have record of the transaction ('could not be fetched'). After a few hours and emails with their support, they assured me it went thru successfully and sent me a link on SUBSCAN where it does show the transaction with a checkmark going to my wallet, But my wallet balance has not updated to show the new total amount after 48 hrs on ledger or Polkascan or Subscan. Even my ledger account is inconsistent. My ledger desktop app doesn't show the transaction in my history but the phone ledger app does. I've connected to my ledger wallet via polkadot.js and it does not show that DOT transcation being received. What is going on????

Does anyone have any advice? Really devastating amount of DOT to have locked up in limbo.

""Our competitors are still building Toyota Prius, while we are building Teslas.""

\- Chris Li, the CEO of Oak Network giving us a snippet of his goal for Oak.

OAK Network is a blockchain for payments and financial infrastructure for Web 3.0 by harnessing the power of Polkadot. It's used for cross-chain automation, enabling multi-chain apps to schedule and automate any substrate extrinsic or EVM smart contract function.

The current solutions that we see with automation are web 2.5 solutions. These leverage heavily bots and smart contracts as middlemen, which then leaves them exposed to vulnerability and large area of attack.

The development of Oak's Event Palettes is broken down into 3 stages: **Time Trigger**, **Price Trigger**, & **Smart Contract Trigger**

Time Trigger is currently completed and Price Trigger is almost completed.   


Do you believe Automation will be useful for the blockchain and on PolkaDot?

Unfortunately, similar tool doesn't exist for all parachain ecosystem.

- Claim 25 time on Astar
- Switch 3 time on different validator for moonbeam
- Switch 2 time on different validator for KILT
- Use polkadot js interface at command level to configure Turing staking

For more information, check[ this table](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking#why-am-i-not-receiving-rewards) to understand why you might not receive staking rewards.

## Around 50% of the total nominators will not receive rewards in era #966 on Polkadot 

As shown in the[ Staking Dashboard Overview](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview), there are currently 45,887 nominators on Polkadot in era #966, of which 21,943 are active. Thus, more than 22,000 nominators are in some sense ""useless"" as their stake is not backing any validator in the active set. They do not participate in network security and do not receive rewards. 

**This need not be the case, as every nominator on Polkadot network can earn staking rewards by participating in Nomination Pools.** Go to the last section of this post if you would like to know how to participate in Nomination Pools. If you like to dive deeper into why you are not receiving staking rewards when you stake directly, the following sections will explain them in depth.

## Why is there a limit of 22,500 Active Nominators on Polkadot?

At the end of each era, the Nominated Proof of Staking (NPoS) system picks the solution graph that matches nominators and their stake with the validators they nominated.  It does so by maximizing the total stake per validator and minimizing the variance of such stake across all active validators (more info on [this wiki page](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen)). To do this, the top 22,500 nominators from the so-called[ bags list](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking-advanced#bags-list) are provided as input to the NPoS election algorithms. 

Verifying NPoS election solution graph and its score is a memory-intensive operation that needs to be performed within a single block time. Under the current runtime constraints, a solution graph with 22,500 nominators can be verified well within the block production time on Polkadot. There are plans to improve on this and implement [multi-block election solution verification](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9511), after which, the NPoS system can scale to incorporate more nominators.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIIZRJLrBZA&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8&index=5) explains in-depth the bags list and how NPoS works.

## Why aren‚Äôt all the top 22,500 nominators from the bags list earning staking rewards?

You can see how 21,943/22,500 nominators are active. The 557 nominators who are not active do not receive rewards and cannot be slashed either. Those nominators have enough stake to be on the bags list, but they chose validators who did not make it to the active set.  By changing their nominations to Validators who have higher chances of getting into the active set, these nominators significantly improve their chances of earning staking rewards.

## What is the validator oversubscription issue? 

As a nominator, you will receive rewards only if you are active (i.e. if you have been assigned to a validator that is active in the current era), and you are in the top 512 nominators ranked by stake. If your active validator is oversubscribed (i.e. it has more than 512 nominators), then you are competing with other nominators to be in the top 512 by stake. Nominators who do not make it to the top 512 do not receive rewards, but they can get slashed as their stake is currently bonded to that validator and used to secure the network.

Good news is that, with the recent Polkadot upgrade, the number of rewarded nominators per validator increased from 256 to 512. No nominators are affected by the oversubscription issue in era #996, but this is something nominators should be careful about in future eras.

## Validators‚Äô commission 

Another reason you might not receive rewards as an active nominator might be that your currently active validator has 100% commission. This means that such validator will keep the rewards for himself. Validators with 100% commission are mainly exchanges and other custodial services that provide staking options to customers.

## What about the nominators who could not make it to the top 22,500 in the bags-list?

So far, I have explained why there is a maximum of 22,500 active nominators, why of those 22,500 there are 557 who are not active, and why not all 21,943 active nominators may not receive rewards due to oversubscription issue.. But what about the remaining nominators who do not make it to the top 22,500 in the bags list?

Those nominators bonded funds but are not participating in NPoS as they did not enter the bags list. The reason is that those nominators did not bond funds greater than the min-active nomination. If you cannot add more tokens to your nomination account, the best option for you is to join a nomination pool to start earning staking rewards.

## How can Nomination Pools help every nominator on Polkadot receive Staking rewards?

Being a nominator requires some knowledge about how Polkadot NPoS works. Ensuring staking rewards also requires bonding a minimum amount of tokens whose value is dynamic and may change in each era (it is 265 DOT in era #966 is the dynamic active minimum and you have to bond more than that).

Nomination Pools provide a simple but elegant solution that ensures everyone can participate in Polkadot staking and earn rewards starting from 1 DOT. The pool essentially acts as a single nominator. The pool admin does the work of nominating validators and ensuring that staking rewards are received. 

[joining a nomination pool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDIG7QAApig&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8&index=10) will ensure 1) the bonded funds will be used to secure the network, and 2) the owners of the bonded funds will be rewarded for putting their funds at stake.

## What is Fast Unstaking?

Nominators who bonded funds below the minimum active bond will be able to use a fast unstake option to bypass the 28-day unbonding period. As for era #966, this option is live on Kusama and will be available on Polkadot soon.

See [this wiki page](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot#nominating-vs-joining-a-pool) for more information about the differences between being a nominator and a pool member.

262,2023-01-17,"So as i understand the basics of dot staking i find it really hard to determine what is a good validator to choose. Maybe some of you can give me some more insights on this.

1. As i understand it, my reward on a given day is determined by a) the erapoints of my validator, b) the amount of dot that is bonded to this validator as this determines the share of reward that i get and c) the comission rate.
2. As these stats randomly fluctuate each day i should have to look for average stats of a validator. the only thing i found in this regard is this:

[https://polkadot.js.org/apps//#/staking/query/](https://polkadot.js.org/apps//#/staking/query/)

Here you get average dot rewards/era points (what comes to the same thing?) and average elected stake.

3) If i understand it right the average elected stake can be more important than the commission, because if the era points are about same there should be a 25% reward difference between a Validator with 1,5mio and 2,0Mio average elected stake?

4) It seems some Validators are choosen constantly or almost each day (like Posdog, P2porg or Blockdeamon) and some validators maybe only once a week. Is there any way to find out why that is? It dosnt look random but i cant see the reason. When avoiding the big validator names i ended up with days when not a single one of all my 16 validators was elected.

5) Are there Validators that get constantly reasonable more erapoints that others? If yes what would be the reason for that? Or is this totally random meaning longterm every validator gets the same erapoints per active era?

5) For being outstaked it seems there is no way to determine what is the minimum stake that make sure you are not the ""looser"" on oversubscribed validators. Here the only viable solution seems to increase the stake to an amount that make this problem obsolete or live with some rewardless days.

So how you choose Validators?

I am relatively inexperienced so please excuse my newbie question. I had previously asked this question on the Ledger sub but nobody seems to know the answer.

I  attempted to stake 2,300 DOT via my Ledger wallet. When nominating  validators I selected a couple where the commission was reasonable and  not oversubscribed.

On checking my 'Account' tab I see the validators I selected are inactive.

[Account tab showing no active validators present](https://preview.redd.it/g6fjzuqmf8ca1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bad2976c779db91daab0f797e535703e7a724f41)

It doesn't seem to be possible to verify a validator is active prior to selection it in the staking process.

On clicking the validator name I am taken to the [https://polkadot.subscan.io](https://polkadot.subscan.io/) page for the validator but it is not clear here either that the validator is inactive.

please excuse me if this is an annoying noob request but I'm not strongly knowledgable with either Binance Staking or Parachain Slot Auctions. Please help me understand following:

I had locked a small amount of DOT in a Parachain Slot Auction on Binance and have collected minor rewards in the form of ASTAR. The contract says that if my voted project wins (as far as I understand), then my DOT are locked for approximately 24 Months. This will be due end of 2023. Further what I understand is that after the lock period, I will be able to withdraw my assets in the form of BDOT (Binance Wrapped DOT) not native DOT. These BDOT have never been not as valuable as the DOT (in terms of prise) ever since. The loss I write down by converting my BDOT back to any stablecoin or even to DOT is greater than my gains from the slot auction reward. My question is, is there a way to regain my DOT (which I originally placed) without making losses?

OAK Network is a blockchain for payments and financial infrastructure for Web 3.0 by harnessing the power of Polkadot. It's used for cross-chain automation, enabling multi-chain apps to schedule and automate any substrate extrinsic or EVM smart contract function.

The current solutions that we see with automation are web 2.5 solutions. These leverage heavily bots and smart contracts as middlemen, which then leaves them exposed to vulnerability and large area of attack.  


2023 is going to be a big year of building for many crypto projects, Oak Network is no different. Peep the formula!

&#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&#x200B;

**Interlay**

* They ventured with Opengov through [Kintsugi](https://twitter.com/kintsugi_btc) which is building Bitcoin DeFi solutions on Kusama and Polkadot.
* Opengov is a new governance system which is already implemented in Kusama but not yet implemented in Polkadot.
* It‚Äôs a very good development to move away from the council-based system to having a more dynamic and fluid democracy on Kusama and hopefully on Polkadot.
* Their testnet for lending is already live.

&#x200B;

**Acurast**

* They are aiming to bring offchain data and computation onchain.
* Enabling price feeds for DeFi projects.
* They are aiming for a parachain slot for the coming next weeks on Kusama.
* Their parachain will serve as a marketplace that brings together data transmitters with trusted execution environments which are infrastructure providers and on the other hand, a developer.
* They have an oracle pallet that can be integrated by parachains.

&#x200B;

**Bit.Country**

* Built on top of Metaverse Network that works as metaverse-as-a-service which enables developers to launch a metaverse project within 12 seconds.
* Their next version of the application will include a rewards campaign which will allow metaverse owners to run different campaigns, ask their communities to perform tasks and all the rewards will      be programmed automatically.
* They already improved their NFT protocols.
* They implemented a snipe function in their marketplace that extends the option for 10 minutes for people that have been beaten at the last minute.
* EVM compatibility has already been implemented.

&#x200B;

**Governance changes on Kusama**

* A runtime version 9340 and 9350 upgrades were voted on and approved by the community.
* Voters can now abstain but their voting power still counts for support calculation which is important for a lot of proposals.
* It also changed the decision periods from 28 days to 14 days at the request of the community.
* All of the proposals are up both for the community on the open governance style and PolkadotJS apps or any of the governance forums.
* The community decided to increase the max number of nomination pools from 64 to 128.

 

**Polkadot proposals**

* First proposal was to use the polka treasury to cover maintenance and cost of running the newsletter which many people find super useful.
* 2022 Polkadot Winter proposal by One Block.
* The proposal that approved the Milestone 3 and 4 development for the hardware signer and key storage Campella.

&#x200B;

**Ajuna Network**

* Their obtaining for parachain took place in auction 31 and their first block was produced soon after which means for their site, that completes their intended setup for both Bajun network and full gaming      network.
* The awesome Ajuna avatars will be launched in January next year.

&#x200B;

**Ternoa**

* It is a substrate chain focused on NFT infrastructure and tools.
* Their engineering efforts comprise of 3 parts, one is the core L1 chain they launched April this year, second is focused on building core NFT primitives into the chain and lastly, infrastructure to      support the NFT activities including IPFS, data indexing queries, cross chain bridges and more.
* Their vision is to be the go to platform for builders and creators of NFTs with utility and privacy.
* They want to advance the state of the Web3 ecosystem for NFTs.
* They are a developer first chain.
* Any marketplace created out of NFT primitives on the Ternoa chain will enforce royalties for the creators.
* They also enable sharing of NFTs with two types, one is delegation where a user can assign their NFT to a wallet and the interpretation is done offchain and two, rental NFTs where a user can      create full-fledged rental contracts between a renter and rentee.
* They also have features that allow NFTs to be kept private and store it long term.
* They have a JavaScript SDK that allows writing complex features.
* They just launched phase 3 of their roadmap.

&#x200B;

**Pendulum**

* They broke the record for the fastest crowd loan to reach its cap within several minutes.
* They released a few papers about their finalized economics and token utility for their $PEN token.
* They‚Äôre thrilled to put the Spacewalk bridge on their testnet.
* Spacewalk bridge is the bridge connecting [Stellar](https://twitter.com/StellarOrg) and Polkadot.

&#x200B;

**727.ventures**

* They just created their new portfolio company which is [Brushfam](https://twitter.com/Brushfam_io).
* Solidity is not enough for full-scale user applications in their opinion.
* They do Ink Advisory which means working with the client‚Äôs team and helping them grow, hire and review.
* Their vision is to help new businesses and technical teams to embolster the ecosystem.

 

**Manta Network**

* Trusted setup campaign goal is to make the largest trusted setup in all of the zkp universe..
* They have collaborated with [Moonbeam](https://twitter.com/MoonbeamNetwork) to work on a palette with XCM remote transact which enables them to do activities on other parachains.
* They‚Äôre starting to enable the first steps in future use cases for enabling privacy in Moonbeam.
* OpenZL is an initiative they are working on supported by Polkadot Grants and it‚Äôs focused on enabling ZKP development for the broader community.
* One of the problems in development for ZK is the actual performance of ZK itself.
* Zprize would allow faster ZK proof generation in the browser rather than being dependent on the signer.

335,2022-12-16,"There have been some misunderstandings regarding some video tutorials on YouTube (especially those about staking). Let me clear them out here.

## Technical Explainers
*FOR EVERYONE.* The [**technical explainer videos**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8) are a collection of videos for a wide audience ranging from beginner to expert. This means that if you are watching a video that is too complex for you, you need to search for another less advanced one.

## Long Tutorials
*FOR EVERYONE.* Some of the videos are above 5 minutes, they are divided into chapters, and you can skip those chapters you do not need.

## Nominating vs Joining a Pool
*FOR EVERYONE.* You need to distinguish between [**NOMINATING**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking) and [**JOINING A POOL**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools). Nominating requires a minimum bond of **100 DOT**, and it is for advanced users that have time to learn how Polkadot works. It requires knowledge about a) how to select and monitor validators, b) what the bags list is, c) what the minimum active bond is, d) troubleshooting in case rewards are not paid out. Being a good nominator takes time and practice.Joining a nomination pool does not require such a deep level of understanding, the minimum bond is **1 DOT,** and you just need to know how to create a stash account and a controller account.So depending on your needs, time, bonded amount, etc. you might prefer one option or the other. You can find the main differences between nominating and joining a pool [**here**](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot#nominating-vs-joining-a-pool).

## Creating Accounts
*FOR EVERYONE*. Before diving into staking on Polkadot, you need to [create an account.](https://youtu.be/DNU0p5G0Gqc) We recommend using the [Polkadot browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/). Note, the extension is not a wallet, it just lists and manages your accounts, and talks to your chromium-based browser. You will be able to use the extension in the next steps (when connecting to the UI or staking dashboard). In the extension, you can also add accounts created with your [Ledger Nano](https://youtu.be/7VlTncHCGPc) or [Parity Signer](https://youtu.be/hgv1R9mPEXw). All stakers will likely need to transfer some funds between accounts (stash, controller, proxies). To transfer funds between accounts, you can watch [this video](https://youtu.be/gbvrHzr4EDY). Make sure you also watch the videos about [restoring accounts](https://youtu.be/9ohp8k4Hz8c) and [changing account passwords](https://youtu.be/DNU0p5G0Gqc).

## Stay Safe
*FOR EVERYONE*. For your own safety, before transferring funds or, in general, using Polkafot accounts, be aware of the followings:
- [Keep your seed phases secure and never share them](https://youtu.be/ARsdXZycJAg)
- [Always verify transactions before signing them](https://youtu.be/gbvrHzr4EDY)

## Using the Staking Dashboard
*FOR EVERYONE.* Unless you have specific needs, you can nominate and join a pool using the [NEW STAKING DASHBOARD](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview). The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface that works nicely on your PC and phone. **We created a mini-series of videos that explains how to use the dashboard**, more precisely:
- [How to nominate](https://youtu.be/F59N3YKYCRs) (for nominators, this includes the creation of stash and controller accounts)
- [How to join a nomination pool](https://youtu.be/dDIG7QAApig)
- A [Dashboard Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/hvXLc4H7rA4) to understand everything displayed on it
- [Everything you can do with dashboard after staking your tokens](https://youtu.be/58pIe8tt2o4)

The dashboard was introduced in Fall 2022, which means that older videos about staking will be using the [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer) instead of the dashboard. Although you can learn how to use the UI, we recommend learning how to use the dashboard first and then, if needed, to start using the UI.

## Using the Polkadot-JS UI (staking)
*FOR NOMINATORS ONLY.* If you are a nominator you should be familiar with the [Polkadot-JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer). Although you can nominate using the dashboard, the UI currently has more functionalities than the dashboard, such as:
- [Managing the Bags List](https://youtu.be/hIIZRJLrBZA)
- [Creating staking proxy accounts](https://youtu.be/WarVBPBPh0A)

## Using the Polkadot-JS UI (general)
*FOR NOMINATORS & ADVANCED USERS*. The Polkadot-JS UI provides advanced additional (cool) advanced features such as:
- [Managing Locks](https://youtu.be/LHgY7ds_bZ0)
- [Participating to Governance](https://youtu.be/fHLhzrd5t-g)
- [Using Pure Proxies](https://youtu.be/YkYApbhU3i0)
- [Batch Transfers](https://youtu.be/uoUC2K8muvw)
- [Vested Transfer](https://youtu.be/JVlwTQBwNGc)
- and more...

349,2022-12-13,"Polkadot Issues in Ledger Live - Official Thread

We've been getting lots of questions about the ongoing issues in Ledger Live. I just wanted to take a moment to explain what's going on and provide some solutions to common issues in the meantime.

**What's going on with Polkadot Accounts in Ledger Live?**

We recently transitioned from a 3rd party backend provider to an in-house system. In the long run, this will provide the flexibility needed to support more detailed account activity in Ledger Live including BatchAll transactions which were previously unsupported. The transition has resulted in some bugs. At first, new staking rewards were not visible in the ""account activity"" list. Users then reported synchronization issues when creating new accounts, and some have reported transactions appearing as ""unconfirmed"" in the activity list. 

It's important to understand that the only impacts are visual. Your accounts will continue earning staking rewards if they are eligible to do so. What you see in Ledger Live may not reflect the actual status of the blockchain. 

**Send/Receive Functionality, as well as all staking-related extrinsics remain functional**\* 

This means you can still bond, nominate, chill and unbond in Ledger Live. These extrinsics may appear as ""unconfirmed"" in your account activity, despite being successfully broadcast to the blockchain. 

\**Withdrawing tokens that have completed the 28 day unbond period is not possible because Ledger Live does not detect the unbonded balance.*

**Issue status**

We do not have an official ETA on the fix, what I can say is that we on the support side are seeing a lot of incoming inquiries and the back-end team is working hard to resolve this ASAP.

**Work-arounds for common issues**

* Seeing Staking Rewards
   * If you just want to check your balance or verify whether you're still receiving rewards, your best bet is to search your address on [Subscan](https://www.subscan.io/). (There's a specific tab for staking rewards in the middle of
* Managing Staking Positions
   * I find that the [Polkadot staking dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview) provides a great experience. We have a help center article detailing how to [connect your Ledger to the staking dashboard](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/7402653416477-How-to-use-the-Polkadot-Staking-Dashboard?docs=true) using the Polkadot.js extension wallet.
* Creating New Polkadot Accounts
   * Finally, if you're trying to set up new accounts associated with your Ledger and facing synchronization errors, you will need to use a compatible 3rd Party wallet. Talisman is a great option ([guide to connect](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4904300456861-How-to-access-your-Ledger-Polkadot-DOT-accounts-and-NFTs-via-Talisman?docs=true)), but if your plan is to stake from the account I'd still just recommend connecting to the dashboard.   
The accounts you access when connecting to a 3rd party wallet will be the same ones you add when Ledger Live is back up and running.
* Re-Synchronzing Ledger Live
   * Once the issue is resolved, you will need to [clear your cache](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012207759-Solve-a-synchronization-error?support=true) to re-synchronize your account.

""Our competitors are still building Toyota Prius, while we are building Teslas.""

Chris Li, the CEO of Oak Network gives a 10,000 ft view of what is being built at OakNetwork.

OAK Network is a blockchain for payments and financial infrastructure for Web 3.0 by harnessing the power of Polkadot. It's used for cross-chain automation, enabling multi-chain apps to schedule and automate any substrate extrinsic or EVM smart contract function.

The current solutions that we see with automation are web 2.5 solutions. These leverage heavily bots and smart contracts as middlemen, which then leaves them exposed to vulnerability and large area of attack.

The development of Oak's Event Palettes are broken down into 3 stages: **Time Trigger**, **Price Trigger**, & **Smart Contract Trigger**

Time Trigger is currently completed and Price Trigger is almost completed. If you're interested in learning more about the Use Cases for OakNetwork check out the full presentation on youtube.

Polkadot 0.9.34 has been released. Note this is a runtime-only release; no new node software is included in this release. [https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.34](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.34)

Runtime upgrades allow Polkadot to change the logic of the chain without hard-forking. For details, see the Polkadot Wiki - [https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-runtime-upgrades](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-runtime-upgrades)

With three days left in the current parachain lease auction, both Hashed Network and OmniBTC have been in the lead during the Ending Period.

This got me thinking, what prevents a large whale from manipulating this process? Let's say they lock up a large chunk of funds and begin voting on their friends proposals (in exchange for an under the table tip) and rejecting their enemies proposals.

I think it is also fair to say that most people are apathetic about gov2 and won't care to vote at all. 

Then we also have to factor in exchanges, many exchanges have already been caught using users funds to vote on proposals (think steemit).

Since voting requires a lockup, the whale would be concerned as to whether staking or voter manipulation is more profitable. This is an even larger concern because the typical holder will be more concerned with staking rewards than voting, but this may not be the case for certain whales.

382,2022-12-03,"Good evening everybody.

   
Short intro: I started with staking dot on binance. A couple of months ago, I started transfering everything to my new ledger. I stake all my coins with my ledger in their native wallets, but the coins are still  stored in my ledger. Atom in keplr, ADA in adalite, but every private key still in my ledger, you know what I mean. 

Dot, i staked on polkadot.js, and after a trial and error period, i finaly figured it out. After more error (because staking limits rising,...) I wanted something more user friendly and found talisman. Sounds good, so went true the unbond period, and today was the day the 28 days were over.

So now: I coupled my ledger with talisman, and DOT are showing, perfect. I coupled the stakingpage of talisman with the talisman wallet, and staked my coins. Rewards are showing , everyting ok. But then I noticed that the action transferred my dot out of my ledger. I suppose to the wallet from talisman staking. And this I find strange and uncomfortable, after getting used to the knowledge that everything is ledgersafe. 

So my questions:

Is this normal? My other coins that are staking on their native wallet are still on my ledger.

Ledger website tells me about talisman "" All Polkadot funds sent to that address will be secured by your Ledger device "", but i have a hard time believing my DOT are secured by ledger when they are not on my device itself.

If it's not normal, if I did something wrong, Can I change it without going true a new 28 days unbond period?

Lesson learned already: I already do test transactions when sending over the network, in the future, i will do test staking transactions.

## [How to Nominate using the Staking Dashboard](https://youtu.be/F59N3YKYCRs)

Nominating on Polkadot has become easier using the dashboard. Remember that to increase the chance of earning staking rewards, you need the Minimum Active Bond (currently ca. 215 DOT). Note that the minimum balance to nominate will soon increase from 10 to 100 DOT.

## [How to Join Nomination Pools using the Staking Dashboard](https://youtu.be/dDIG7QAApig)

Nomination Pools are here to make staking on Polkadot more democratic. Now with 1 DOT you can join a pool and start earning rewards. Everybody can now contribute and help Polkadot to stay secure. Join more than 2000 pool members! Joining a pool is a decentralized and non-custodial solution native to Polkadot.

## [Learn everything about the Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://youtu.be/hvXLc4H7rA4)

The dashboard is here to make life easier for nominators and pool members. This video explains everything you should know about the dashboard.

## [What you can do after Staking using the Dashboard](https://youtu.be/58pIe8tt2o4)

Nominating on Polkadot is not a set-and-forget action (note here I am speaking about pool members). Nominators (and thus pool administrators, too) must constantly check their validators and change them if necessary.

## [Understanding Bags List and Minimum Active Bond](https://youtu.be/hIIZRJLrBZA)

Of the 50,000 nomination intents, only 22,500 are kept and sorted in the so-called Bags List. After that, the NPoS algorithm associates nominators with validators to maximize the total stake per validator and minimize the variance across all validators. This is what keeps Polkadot secure! Learn more about that in this video, especially how you can guarantee daily staking rewards.

Account derivation is a practical way of having different accounts with one mnemonic seed (not speaking about Ledger here, although you can derive ledger accounts, too!). Learn about account derivation; it might become useful one day!

## [Existential Deposit & KeepAlive Transfers](https://youtu.be/mgPHVztHJWk)

To use your account on Polkadot, you need the existential deposit (1 DOT). KeepAlive Transfers ensure your account has 1 DOT after transferring funds and paying transaction fees. This video shows some errors you might see while transferring funds when your account has a poor balance.

## [How to Install the Developer Release of the Polkadot Ledger App](https://youtu.be/4SyVQrlXZ_Q)

Ledger Apps for the Polkadot ecosystem are usually released on Ledger Live and made available when there are upgrades on the blockchain. Sometimes, the audition of the apps by Ledger takes a bit longer than expected, and it could be that your ledger app remains outdated for a couple of days compared to the current runtime version. This will cause you not to be able to make transactions. Knowing how to install the developer release might help in emergencies. Do this only if you need to, and remember always to have your seed phrase in case you need to recover your ledger accounts!",0.04567789286375046,0.022415772080421448,0.9319063425064087,2.558155301525032

Until now I have been staking my DOT on Kraken. I think about using the new nomination pools.

To decide on a pool I would need to know the following:

(1) Where can I find each pool's rewards APR on this staking dashboard? Presumably, the reward rate will vary among nomiation pools.

(2) And how can I find out if the respective pool operators/creators are reputable? If I don't have any reliable information on this, in the end staking on Kraken is safer for me.",0.04131653904914856,0.03777027502655983,0.9209131598472595,2.508865660287662

414,2022-11-26,Hi all. I am looking for a platform to find an answer to a question making me think for a while. I am a quiet big believer of the ecosystem as you may see from my adress however there is one thing that concerns me a bit lately. Polkadots value proposition is really amazing and a lot of good influencers and YouTubers are criticizing polkadot due to the fact that it really has almost no use case. So currently people are holding Dot for two reasons mainly. 1. Staking and 2. Parachain auctions. However there are no other use case or burn mechanism such as Etherum or some other L1‚Äôs . So I would really like to ask what is the narrative behind the demand growth of Polkadot in the future? Parachains are utilizing their own tokens polkadot is not needed for a transaction on Astar or Moonbeam. In the current market conditions when 2 year will be over for the first 5 parachain around a hundred million polkadot will become free which would possibly create a huge sell pressure. So I want to ask if the team has a plan for the polkadot to create a use case and demand in the future? You may not ask my question but I would appreciate if you could at least guide me on where to find the answer.,0.059122275561094284,0.0685664564371109,0.8723112344741821,2.476389547018356

\- Unique Network - for nfts

\- Astar - smart contracts

\- Moonbeam - for smart contracts as well

\- Acala - defi as well

\- Bifrost - bridge, defi, smart contracts, everything

If you want to know more, here. Coinmarketcap details them.

I'll pick a best, I'll pick Unique Network. And it's not that it's really the overall best, it's one I have monitored closely enough. It's one of the busiest parachains on Polkadot. And it's really giving its best to NFT adoption. And if I will add, its recent partnerships also give nft a boost. For instance, Lemonade Social, one of its partners minted 10K NFTs for the Coin Bureau event. I think that's putting NFTs to good use tho. But I still think NFTs are in their infancy and we'll see better use cases in future.

457,2022-11-14,"It‚Äôs been hard to ignore the events of recent days and the spectacular implosion of FTX has shone a spotlight on the systemic risk of using centralised exchanges to store and trade crypto assets.

It seems with each passing month there is yet another story of users having their funds frozen, lost or mismanaged by those who have been entrusted to keep them safe.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we believe that CEX‚Äôs play an integral role in onboarding new users into crypto and helping facilitate easy on / off-ramping of crypto into fiat, but the plain and simple truth is that storing funds on an exchange is risky business.

Non-custodial wallets play a vital role in providing users with a safer alternative to storing their assets on centralised exchanges, but there is a lot of work to be done around educating individuals of the importance of managing your own keys and best-practices around security.

Centralised exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken have done an incredible job providing users with an easy way to buy, trade and stake crypto, however, the only way to truly ensure you‚Äôre not going to get pwned by another FTX is to self-custody your funds in a hot wallet or cold storage.

Our mission at Talisman is to make this transition to self-custody simple and safe in order to empower people to truly own and control their digital assets. If you‚Äôre even a little nervous about keeping your funds on a centralised exchange we suggest using a combination of a browser wallet (like Talisman) and a Ledger hardware wallet. If you‚Äôve got any questions or need help let us know in the comments.

It‚Äôs a jungle out there, be safe.

486,2022-11-02,"Hi everyone, following the release of polkadot nomination pools we have been creating a tool to help you select the best based on a set of best practices:

* The root user is verified
* The root user has skin in the game (self stake)
* The pool's validators meet general standards (see the dot validator selector below)
* The pool is in an open state
* The pool has selected an optimal number of validators
* The pool does not have duplicate validators (validators under the same entity)

This module is totally open source and available here: https://github.com/TalismanSociety/dot-pool-selector

If you don't want to run the module yourself, you can also get a cached result from an API that updates daily: https://dot-tool-server.herokuapp.com/dot-pool-selector

Other potentially helpful resources:

* Get the best validators programmatically: https://james-sangalli.github.io/dot-validator-selector/
* Get your staking income as a spreadsheet: https://james-sangalli.github.io/dot-staking-income-web/

Hey everyone,

Nomination pools is now live on Polkadot and we're really excited to share our new staking feature on the [Talisman web app](https://app.talisman.xyz/staking). 

It's by far the easiest way to stake your DOT and only takes a few seconds to get started. You can use your Ledger and we'll automatically suggest the best pools for you. No complicated set-up required.

We're really overwhelmed by the positive response from the community thus far and hope that by improving the staking experience we can bring many new users into the ecosystem.

If you have any suggestions or feedback please let us know in the comments.

I used to stake it all on Kraken for a while and felt... let's say not confident enough keeping it all in somebody elses custody, so I moved it all on my Ledger and staked it.

Questions:

1. I learned about the slashing part on validators - what are the chances of a validator being actually critically slashed - level 3 or 4, not only for the current era - for example, how often does that occur?I know it's a real possibility for me to lose it all in theory, but in reality, is it really or am I overthinking it. I'm debating whether it's not safer to move it back to Kraken, I'm at that level of overthinking it.
2. Some of the validators I have picked are ""big"" ones - p2p, blockdaemon, they seem to have many validators but not all of them have own stake. For example p2p have more than a dozen validators, only 2 of which have 1k+ own stake, some only 22 dots (which is nothing) and some have literally nothing. Do I nominate only the ones that have own stake or Im okay with trusting the p2p ""brand"" and be safe with others p2p's too?  
Blockdaemon I've heard is safe to pick too, but half of them have nothing on ""own stake"" and others have only 1 dot.   
I am obviously missing something here. ",0.041815146803855896,0.08290039747953415,0.8752844333648682,2.397286871014987

Hey everyone,

Over the past year building in Polkadot we‚Äôve encountered a familiar story from users who are sick of the complicated interfaces and developer-centric tools they need to use in order to do something as simple as stake their DOT.

‚ÄúIn other ecosystems like Solana it‚Äôs simple and takes two clicks‚Äù, they say. Pleading with us to launch a staking feature.

For newer entrants to the Polkadot ecosystem (and even existing users) staking has always been an overly complicated ordeal, with advanced account set-ups and complex validator management.

We believe that for the Polkadot ecosystem to flourish people should be able to stake their DOT in seconds, not minutes. So with the launch of nomination pools on Polkadot we‚Äôre releasing a new staking feature in the web app which lets anyone get started with staking in just a couple of clicks.

Users will be able to **stake as little as 1 DOT** and we‚Äôll automatically select the best pool using a custom-built validator selection tool. There is over 18,000 addresses currently not receiving any staking rewards, probably due to the mental gymnastics required to set up and manage validators properly.

Our goal is to make staking in Polkadot as easy as it is in other ecosystems, and thanks to nomination pools everyone can now participate.

Keep an eye out over the next few days for more updates.",0.06144730746746063,0.05483301356434822,0.8837196230888367,2.5165357356817872
